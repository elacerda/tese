	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between star formation rate surface density, SigmaSFR, and gas surface density, Sigmagas, at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18 nearby galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies, 24 mum data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 relates SigmaSFR and SigmaH2 across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is ~2 × 109 years. The range of SigmaH2 over which we measure this relation is ~3-50 M sun pc-2, significantly lower than in starburst environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with approximately uniform properties and that SigmaH2 may be more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total gas surface density (Sigmagas) and SigmaSFR varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between SigmaHI and SigmaSFR. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE), SigmaSFR/Sigmagas, varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is systematic and consistent with the SFE being set by local environmental factors: in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the SFE. In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at SigmaHI ≈ 9 M sun pc-2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

	Abstract = {We study the properties of the cold gas component of the interstellar medium of the Herschel Reference Survey, a complete volume-limited (15 ≲ D ≲ 25 Mpc), K-band-selected sample of galaxies spanning a wide range in morphological type (from ellipticals to dwarf irregulars) and stellar mass (109 ≲ Mstar ≲ 1011 M&sun;). The multifrequency data in our hands are used to trace the molecular gas mass distribution and the main scaling relations of the sample, which put strong constraints on galaxy formation simulations. We extend the main scaling relations concerning the total and the molecular gas component determined for massive galaxies (Mstar ≳ 1010 M&sun;) from the COLD GASS survey down to stellar masses Mstar ~= 109 M&sun;. As scaling variables we use the total stellar mass Mstar, the stellar surface density mustar, the specific star formation rate SSFR, and the metallicity of the target galaxies. By comparing molecular gas masses determined using a constant or a luminosity dependent XCO conversion factor, we estimate the robustness of these scaling relations on the very uncertain assumptions used to transform CO line intensities into molecular gas masses. The molecular gas distribution of a K-band-selected sample is significantly different from that of a far-infrared-selected sample since it includes a significantly smaller number of objects with M(H2) ≲ 6 × 109 M&sun;. In spiral galaxies the molecular gas phase is only 25-30% of the atomic gas. The analysis also indicates that the slope of the main scaling relations depends on the adopted conversion factor. Among the sampled relations, all those concerning M(gas)/Mstar are statistically significant and show little variation with XCO. We observe a significant correlation between M(H2)/Mstar and SSFR, M(H2)/M(Hi) and mustar, M(H2)/M(Hi) and 12 + log (O/H), regardless of the adopted XCO. The total and molecular gas consumption timescales are anticorrelated with the specific star formation rate. The comparison of HRS and COLD GASS data indicates that some of the observed scaling relations are nonlinear.},

	Abstract = {We present an extended version of the spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT designed to incorporate both lambda-by-lambda spectra and photometric fluxes in the estimation of stellar population properties of galaxies. The code is tested with simulations and data for 260 galaxies culled from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, spatially matching the 3700-7000 {\AA} optical data cubes to Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) images. The sample spans E-Sd galaxies with masses from 109 to 1012 M&sun; and stellar populations all the way from star-forming to old, passive systems. Comparing results derived from purely optical fits with those which also consider the NUV and FUV data we find that the following. (1) The new code is capable of matching the input ultraviolet (UV) data within the errors while keeping the quality of the optical fit essentially unchanged. (2) Despite being unreliable predictors of the UV fluxes, purely optical fits yield stellar population properties which agree well with those obtained in optical+UV fits for nearly 90 per cent of our sample. (3) The addition of UV constraints has little impact on properties such as stellar mass and dust optical depth. Mean stellar ages and metallicities also remain nearly the same for most galaxies, the exception being low-mass, late-type galaxies, which become older and less enriched due to rearrangements of their youngest populations. (4) The revised ages are better correlated with observables such as the 4000 {\AA} break index, and the NUV - r and u - r colours, an empirical indication that the addition of UV constraints helps mitigating the effects of age-metallicity-extinction degeneracies.},

	Abstract = {The KINGFISH project (Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 61 nearby (d < 30 Mpc) galaxies, chosen to cover a wide range of galaxy properties and local interstellar medium (ISM) environments found in the nearby universe. Its broad goals are to characterize the ISM of present-day galaxies, the heating and cooling of their gaseous and dust components, and to better understand the physical processes linking star formation and the ISM. KINGFISH is a direct descendant of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), which produced complete Spitzer imaging and spectroscopic mapping and a comprehensive set of multiwavelength ancillary observations for the sample. The Herschel imaging consists of complete maps for the galaxies at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum. The spectral line imaging of the principal atomic ISM cooling lines ([O I] 63 mum, [O III] 88 mum, [N II] 122,205 mum, and [C II] 158 mum) covers the subregions in the centers and disks that already have been mapped in the mid-infrared with Spitzer. The KINGFISH and SINGS multiwavelength data sets combined provide panchromatic mapping of the galaxies sufficient to resolve individual star-forming regions, and tracing the important heating and cooling channels of the ISM, across a wide range of local extragalactic ISM environments. This article summarizes the scientific strategy for KINGFISH, the properties of the galaxy sample, the observing strategy, and data processing and products. It also presents a combined Spitzer and Herschel image atlas for the KINGFISH galaxies, covering the wavelength range 3.6-500 mum. All imaging and spectroscopy data products will be released to the Herschel user-generated product archives.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Kewley.etal.2001a,
	Abstract = {We have modeled a large sample of infrared starburst galaxies using both the PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the young star clusters. PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks, while STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two. We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models that include a self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 ryd region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in the 1-4 ryd range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R stars. The PEGASE models use the Clegg & Middlemass planetary nebula nuclei (PNN) atmosphere models for the W-R stars, whereas the STARBURST99 models use the Schmutz, Leitherer, & Gruenwald W-R atmosphere models. We believe that the Schmutz et al. atmospheres are more applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample; however, they do not produce the hard EUV field in the 1-4 ryd region required by our observations. The inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution. Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is <<20%. The models presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for starbursts and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically derived stellar mass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z < 0.65; median z= 0.2) galaxies in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic redshift survey. These masses, as well as the full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public as part of GAMA data release 2. Although the GAMA database does include near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fits is significantly poorer when these NIR data are included. Further, for a large fraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from the optical-plus-NIR photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred from the optical data alone. This may indicate problems in our stellar population library, or NIR data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for future versions of the catalogue. For now, we have chosen to base our stellar mass estimates on optical photometry only. In light of our decision to ignore the available NIR data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained based on optical data alone. We use generic properties of stellar population synthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle a very good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, M*/Li. Further, we use the observed relation between restframe (g-i) and M*/Li for real GAMA galaxies to argue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves, (g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate M*/Li to an accuracy of ≲0.1 dex (1sigma). This 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-M*/Li relation offers a simple and transparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimal data, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their results to z≲0.4 measurements from GAMA.},

@article{Garnett.2002a,
	Abstract = {I present results on the correlation between galaxy mass, luminosity, and metallicity for a sample of spiral and irregular galaxies having well-measured abundance profiles, distances, and rotation speeds. Additional data for low surface brightness galaxies from the literature are also included for comparison. These data are combined to study the metallicity-luminosity and metallicity-rotation speed correlations for spiral and irregular galaxies. The metallicity-luminosity correlation shows its familiar form for these galaxies, a roughly uniform change in the average present-day O/H abundance of about a factor of 100 over 11 mag in B luminosity. However, the O/H-Vrot relation shows a change in slope at a rotation speed of about 125 km s-1. At faster Vrot, there appears to be no relation between average metallicity and rotation speed. At lower Vrot, the metallicity correlates with rotation speed. This change in behavior could be the result of increasing loss of metals from the smaller galaxies in supernova-driven winds. This idea is tested by looking at the variation in effective yield, derived from observed abundances and gas fractions assuming closed box chemical evolution. The effective yields derived for spiral and irregular galaxies increase by a factor of 10-20 from Vrot~5 to 300 km s-1, asymptotically increasing to approximately constant yeff for Vrot>~150 km s-1. The trend suggests that galaxies with Vrot<~100-150 km s-1 may lose a large fraction of their supernova ejecta, while galaxies above this value tend to retain metals.},

@article{Grootes.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between B-band face-on central optical depth due to dust, tau ^f_B, and the stellar mass surface density, mu*, of nearby (z <= 0.13) spiral galaxies: {log}(tau ^{f}_{B}) = 1.12(+/- 0.11) \cdot {log}({mu _{*}}/{{M}_{&sun; } {kpc}^{-2}}) - 8.6(+/- 0.8). This relation was derived from a sample of spiral galaxies taken from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, which were detected in the FIR/submillimeter (submm) in the Herschel-ATLAS science demonstration phase field. Using a quantitative analysis of the NUV attenuation-inclination relation for complete samples of GAMA spirals categorized according to stellar mass surface density, we demonstrate that this correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuation purely on the basis of optical photometry and S{\'e}rsic-profile morphological fits. Considered together with previously established empirical relationships of stellar mass to metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and high constant of proportionality of the tau ^f_B - mu_{*} relation disfavors a stellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, instead being consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanism for the growth of dust in the interstellar medium. We use the tau ^f_B - mu_{*} relation in conjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of Popescu & Tuffs to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and stellar surface density, in which attenuation of the UV light used for the measurement of SFR is corrected on an object-to-object basis. A marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which we demonstrate is due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-on components of attenuation. Our results are consistent with a general picture of spiral galaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing in translucent structures, exposed to UV in the diffuse interstellar radiation field.},

@article{Santini.etal.2014a,
	Abstract = {We use deep Herschel observations taken with both PACS and SPIRE imaging cameras to estimate the dust mass of a sample of galaxies extracted from the GOODS-S, GOODS-N and the COSMOS fields. We divide the redshift-stellar mass (Mstar)-star formation rate (SFR) parameter space into small bins and investigate average properties over this grid. In the first part of the work we investigate the scaling relations between dust mass, stellar mass and SFR out to z = 2.5. No clear evolution of the dust mass with redshift is observed at a given SFR and stellar mass. We find a tight correlation between the SFR and the dust mass, which, under reasonableassumptions, is likely a consequence of the Schmidt-Kennicutt (S-K) relation. The previously observed correlation between the stellar content and the dust content flattens or sometimes disappears when considering galaxies with the same SFR. Our finding suggests that most of the correlation between dust mass and stellar mass obtained by previous studies is likely a consequence of the correlation between the dust mass and the SFR combined with the main sequence, i.e., the tight relation observed between the stellar mass and the SFR and followed by the majority of star-forming galaxies. We then investigate the gas content as inferred from dust mass measurements. We convert the dust mass into gas mass by assuming that the dust-to-gas ratio scales linearly with the gas metallicity (as supported by many observations). For normal star-forming galaxies (on the main sequence) the inferred relation between the SFR and the gas mass (integrated S-K relation) broadly agrees with the results of previous studies based on CO measurements, despite the completely different approaches. We observe that all galaxies in the sample follow, within uncertainties, the same S-K relation. However, when investigated in redshift intervals, the S-K relation shows a moderate, but significant redshift evolution. The bulk of the galaxy population at z ~ 2 converts gas into stars with an efficiency (star formation efficiency, SFE = SFR/Mgas, equal to the inverse of the depletion time) about 5 times higher than at z ~ 0. However, it is not clear what fraction of such variation of the SFE is due to an intrinsic redshift evolution and what fraction is simply a consequence of high-z galaxies having, on average, higher SFR, combined with the super-linear slope of the S-K relation (while other studies find a linear slope). We confirm that the gas fraction (fgas = Mgas/(Mgas + Mstar)) decreases with stellar mass and increases with the SFR. We observe no evolution with redshift once Mstarand SFR are fixed. We explain these trends by introducing a universal relation between gas fraction, stellar mass and SFR that does not evolve with redshift, at least out to z ~ 2.5. Galaxies move across this relation as their gas content evolves across the cosmic epochs. We use the 3D fundamental fgas-Mstar-SFR relation, along with the evolution of the main sequence with redshift, to estimate the evolution of the gas fraction in the average population of galaxies as a function of redshift and as a function of stellar mass: we find that Mstar ≳ 1011 M&sun; galaxies show the strongest evolution at z ≳ 1.3 and a flatter trend at lower redshift, while fgas decreases more regularly over the entire redshift range probed in Mstar ≲ 1011 M&sun; galaxies, in agreement with a downsizing scenario.

	Abstract = {We present the first systematic investigation into the metallicity gradients in galaxy close pairs. We determine the metallicity gradients for eight galaxies in close pairs using H II region metallicities obtained with high signal-to-noise multi-slit observations with the Keck LRIS Spectrograph. We show that the metallicity gradients in close pairs are significantly shallower than gradients in isolated spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, M83, and M101. These observations provide the first solid evidence that metallicity gradients in interacting galaxies are systematically different from metallicity gradients in isolated spiral galaxies. Our results suggest that there is a strong relationship between metallicity gradients and the gas dynamics in galaxy interactions and mergers.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

@article{Charlot.Fall.2000a,
	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

@article{Charlot.Longhetti.2001a,
	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing consistently the line and continuum emission from galaxies, based on a combination of recent population synthesis and photoionization codes. We use effective parameters to describe the Hii regions and the diffuse gas ionized by single stellar generations in a galaxy, among which the most important ones are the zero-age effective ionization parameter, the effective gas metallicity and the effective dust-to-heavy element ratio. We calibrate the nebular properties of our model using the observed [Oiii]/Hbeta, [Oii]/[Oiii], [Sii]/Halpha and [Nii]/[Sii] ratios of a representative sample of nearby spiral and irregular, starburst and Hii galaxies. To compute whole (line plus continuum) spectral energy distributions, we include the absorption by dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) using a recent simple prescription, which is consistent with observations of nearby starburst galaxies. Our model enables us to interpret quantitatively the observed optical spectra of galaxies in terms of stars, gas and dust parameters. We find that the range of ionized-gas properties spanned by nearby galaxies implies factors of 3.5 and 14 variations in the Halpha and [Oii] luminosities produced per unit star formation rate (SFR). When accounting for stellar Halpha absorption and absorption by dust in the neutral ISM, the actual uncertainties in SFR estimates based on the emergent Halpha and [Oii] luminosities are as high as several decades. We derive new estimators of the SFR, the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the effective absorption optical depth of the dust in galaxies. We show that, with the help of other lines such as [Oii], Hbeta, [Oiii], [Nii] or [Sii], the uncertainties in SFR estimates based on Halpha can be reduced to a factor of only 2-3, even if the Halpha line is blended with the adjacent [Nii] lines. Without Halpha, however, the SFR is difficult to estimate from the [Oii], Hbeta and [Oiii] lines. The reason for this is that the absorption by dust in the neutral ISM and the ionized-gas parameters are then difficult to constrain independently. This suggests that, while insufficient by itself, the Halpha line is essential for estimating the star formation rate from the optical emission of a galaxy.},

@article{Wong.Blitz.2002a,
	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between H I, H2, and the star formation rate (SFR) using azimuthally averaged data for seven CO-bright spiral galaxies. Contrary to some earlier studies based on global fluxes, we find that SigmaSFR exhibits a much stronger correlation with SigmaH2 than with SigmaHI, as SigmaHI saturates at a value of ~ 10 Msolar pc-2 or even declines for large SigmaSFR. Hence, the good correlation between SigmaSFR and the total (H I+H2) gas surface density Sigmagas is driven by the molecular component in these galaxies, with the observed relation between SigmaSFR and SigmaH2 following a Schmidt-type law of index nmol~0.8 if a uniform extinction correction is applied or nmol~1.4 for a radially varying correction dependent on gas density. The corresponding Schmidt law indices for Sigmagas versus SigmaSFR are 1.1 and 1.7 for the two extinction models, in rough agreement with previous studies of the disk-averaged star formation law. An alternative to the Schmidt law, in which the gas depletion timescale is proportional to the orbital timescale, is also consistent with the data if radially varying extinction corrections are applied. We find no clear evidence for a link between the gravitational instability parameter for the gas disk (Qg) and the SFR, and we suggest that Qg be considered a measure of the gas fraction. This implies that for a state of marginal gravitational stability to exist in galaxies with low gas fractions, it must be enforced by the stellar component. In regions where we have both H I and CO measurements, the ratio of H I to H2 surface density scales with radius as roughly R1.5, and we suggest that the balance between H I and H2 is determined primarily by the midplane interstellar pressure. These results favor a ``law'' of star formation in quiescent disks in which the ambient pressure and metallicity control the formation of molecular clouds from H I, with star formation then occurring at a roughly constant rate per unit H2 mass.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present an analysis of the relation between the star formation rate (SFR) surface density (SigmaSFR) and mass surface density of molecular gas (SigmaH2), commonly referred to as the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation, on its intrinsic spatial scale, i.e. the size of giant molecular clouds (~10-150 pc), in the central, high-density regions of four nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN). These are AGN extracted from the NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) survey. This study investigates the correlations and slopes of the K-S relation, as a function of spatial resolution and of the different 12CO emission lines used to trace SigmaH2, and tests its validity in the high-density central regions of spiral galaxies.  Methods: We used interferometric IRAM 12CO(1-0) and 12CO(2-1) and SMA 12CO(3-2) emission line maps to derive SigmaH2 and HST-Halpha images to estimate SigmaSFR.  Results: Each galaxy is characterized by a distinct molecular SF relation on spatial scales between 20 to 200 pc. The K-S relations can be sublinear, but also superlinear, with slopes ranging from ~0.5 to ~1.3; slopes are generally superlinear on spatial scales >100 pc and sublinear on smaller scales. Depletion times range from ~1 and 2 Gyr, which is compatible with results for nearby normal galaxies. These findings are valid independently of which transition - 12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), or 12CO(3-2) - is used to derive SigmaH2. Because of either star-formation feedback, the lifetime of clouds, turbulent cascade, or magnetic fields, the K-S relation might be expected to degrade on small spatial scales (<100 pc). However, we find no clear evidence of this, even on scales as small as ~20 pc, and this might be because of the higher density of GMCs in galaxy centers that have to resist higher shear forces. The proportionality between SigmaH2 and SigmaSFR found between 10 and 100 M&sun; pc-2 is valid even at high densities, ~103 M&sun; pc-2. However, by adopting a common CO-to-H2 conversion factor (alphaCO), the central regions of the NUGA galaxies have higher SigmaSFR for a given gas column than those expected from the models, with a behavior that lies between the mergers or high-redshift starburst systems and the more quiescent star-forming galaxies, assuming that the first ones require a lower value of alphaCO.

@article{CatalanTorrecilla.etal.2015a,
	Abstract = {Context. The star formation rate (SFR) is one of the main parameters used to analyze the evolution of galaxies through time. The need for recovering the light reprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolution far-infrared data. Recombination line luminosities provide an alternative, although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrowband imaging or long-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) is clearly the way to overcome this kind of limitation.  Aims: We obtain integrated Halpha, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR)-based SFR measurements for 272 galaxies from the CALIFA survey at 0.005 <z< 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. We aim to determine whether the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosities provide a good measure of the SFR and to shed light on the origin of the discrepancies between tracers. Updated calibrations referred to Halpha are provided. The well-defined selection criteria and large statistics allow us to carry out this analysis globally and split by properties, including stellar mass and morphological type.  Methods: We derive integrated, extinction-corrected Halpha fluxes from CALIFA, UV surface and asymptotic photometry from GALEX and integrated WISE 22 mum and IRAS fluxes.  Results: We find that the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosity agrees with the hybrid updated SFR estimators based on either UV or Halpha plus IR luminosity over the full range of SFRs (0.03-20 M&sun; yr-1). The coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born stars that is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, aIR, shows a large dispersion. However, this coefficient does not became increasingly small at high attenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured Halpha emission were missed, i.e., after a Balmer decrement-based attenuation correction is applied. Lenticulars, early-type spirals, and type-2 AGN host galaxies show smaller coefficients because of the contribution of optical photons and AGN to dust heating.  Conclusions: In the local Universe, the Halpha luminosity derived from IFS observations can be used to measure SFR, at least in statistically-significant, optically-selected galaxy samples, once stellar continuum absorption and dust attenuation effects are accounted for. The analysis of the SFR calibrations by galaxies properties could potentially be used by other works to study the impact of different selection criteria in the SFR values derived, and to disentangle selection effects from other physically motivated differences, such as environmental or evolutionary effects.

@article{Lada.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We investigate Schmidt's conjecture (i.e., that the star formation rate (SFR) scales in a power-law fashion with the gas density) for four well-studied local molecular clouds (giant molecular clouds, GMCs). Using the Bayesian methodology, we show that a local Schmidt scaling relation of the form \Sigma _{*}({A}_{{K}}) = \kappa {A}_{{K}}^{\beta } (protostars pc-2) exists within (but not between) GMCs. Further, we find that the Schmidt scaling law does not by itself provide an adequate description of star formation activity in GMCs. Because the total number of protostars produced by a cloud is given by the product of Sigma*(A K) and S'(> A K), the differential surface area distribution function, integrated over the entire cloud, the cloud's structure plays a fundamental role in setting the level of its star formation activity. For clouds with similar functional forms of Sigma*(A K), observed differences in their total SFRs are primarily due to the differences in S'(> A K) between the clouds. The coupling of Sigma*(A K) with the measured S'(> A K) in these clouds also produces a steep jump in the SFR and protostellar production above AK ~ 0.8 mag. Finally, we show that there is no global Schmidt law that relates the SFR and gas mass surface densities between GMCs. Consequently, the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt scaling relation for disk galaxies is likely an artifact of unresolved measurements of GMCs and not a result of any underlying physical law of star formation characterizing the molecular gas.},

	Abstract = {AAT/IPCS spectra were obtained from six H II regions at differing radial distances from the center of the Scd galaxy NGC 300 and from three H II regions in the giant barred spiral NGC 1365 which has an active nucleus. The spectra were analyzed to determine abundances of the elements represented by observed emission lines from a combination of electron temperatures based on various weak temperature-sensitive lines and interpolation between photoionization models, using the sum of (O II) and (O III) intensities relative to the H beta emission to select plausible model parameters. The NGC 300 and NGC 1365 abundances are described, noting that the abundances of the latter are fairly close to solar. One object in NGC 300 is unusual in having stronger (O II) than usually found in giant H II regions in Scd galaxies, and neon, sulphur, and argon abundances relative to oxygen are close to those of Orion and the Magellanic Clouds, while the He/H ratio appears slightly lower than in Orion.},

@article{Calzetti.1997a,
	Abstract = {The reddening properties and the star formation history of a sample of 19 starburst galaxies are investigated using multiwavelength spectroscopy and infrared broad band photometry. New photometric data in the J, H, and K bands of the central starburst regions are supplemented with previously published spectra, covering the wavelength range 0.12-2.2 mu m. In the infrared, the reddening value derived for the stellar continuum is in agreement with that of the ionized gas, but the two values diverge at shorter wavelengths; in the UV, the mean optical depth of the dust in front of the stars is smaller, being only 60%, than the optical depth of the dust in front of the nebular gas. This difference can be better understood if the UV-bright stellar population and the ionized gas are not co-spatial. A model of foreground clumpy dust, with different covering factors for the gas and the stars, is proposed to account for the difference in reddening. A ``template starburst spectrum'', derived by combining the reddening-corrected UV, optical, and infrared data of all the galaxies in the sample, is used to investigate the star formation history of the galaxies. Spectral synthesis models indicate that the observed UV emission can be attributed to a stellar population which is undergoing active star formation at a constant rate since ~ 2x10(7) yr, in agreement with the supernova rates derived from the [FeII] emission line in the infrared. At least two, and probably more, intermediate age populations (age<2x10(9) yr) contribute to the optical and infrared emission, while populations older than ~ 2x10(9) yr do not contribute significantly to the template. The stellar composition of the template spectrum suggests episodic star formation over the last 10(9) yr, with star formation rates as large as or larger than the present rates. The synthetic stellar populations are generated according to an Initial Mass Function (IMF) with Salpeter slope (alpha =2.35) in the mass range 0.1-100 Msun, and reproduce a number of observational constraints, such as the spectral energy distribution of the template spectrum, the equivalent width of the atomic hydrogen emission lines, and the mass-to-light ratios; the data, then, do not provide indication for a high-mass-star truncated or a low-mass-star deficient IMF in starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Ultraviolet and optical narrow and broad band images of NGC 5253 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 are used to derive the properties of the dust distribution and the recent star formation history of this metal-poor dwarf galaxy. Corrections for the effects of dust are important in the center of NGC 5253: dust reddening is markedly inhomogeneous across the galaxy's central 20" region. One of the most obscured regions coincides with the region of highest star formation activity in the galaxy; clouds of more than 9 mag of optical depth at V enshroud a 2.5 Myr old stellar cluster in this area. The ages of the bright clusters in the center of the galaxy are anticorrelated with the amount of dust obscuration the cluster suffers. This result agrees with the expectation that young stellar associations are located in heavily obscured regions, but after only 2-3 Myr they remove/emerge from the parental dust cloud and become almost extinction-free. On average, the continuum emission of the diffuse stellar population is about a factor of 2 less reddened than the ionized gas emission, a behavior typical of starburst galaxies (Calzetti et al. 1994, ApJ, 429, 582). In the case of NGC 5253, this difference originates from the larger scale length of the star distribution relative to the ionized gas: the half light radius of the UV-bright stars is about twice as large as the half light radius of the ionized gas emission. Star formation has been active at least over the past 100 Myr in the central 20" of the galaxy, as indicated by the age distribution of both the blue diffuse stellar population and the bright stellar clusters. The star formation episodes may have been discrete in time, or almost continuous but variable in intensity and spatial extension. The current peak of the star formation is located in a 6" region, more spatially concentrated than the star formation averaged over the past 100 Myr. Its average star formation intensity is 10-5-10-4 Msun/yr/pc2 for a 0.1-100 Msun Salpeter IMF, a factor of 10 to 100 times larger than in the galaxy's central 20". This starburst region contains a stellar population ˜5 Myr old and the two youngest (2.5 Myr and ˜3-4 Myr, respectively) of the bright stellar clusters in the galaxy's center. The two clusters contribute between 20% and 65% of the ionizing photons in the starburst, a contribution between 1.3 and 4.3 times larger than the average over the central 20". This is expected if cluster formation is an important mode of star formation in the early phase of a starburst event. The mass of the 2.5 Myr old cluster may be as large as ˜106 Msun, making this one a Super-Star-Cluster candidate.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the conversion factor relating CO emission to H2 mass, alphaCO, in five Local Group galaxies that span approximately an order of magnitude in metallicity---M 31, M 33, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), NGC 6822, and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We model the dust mass along the line of sight from infrared (IR) emission and then solve for the alphaCO that best allows a single gas-to-dust ratio (deltaGDR) to describe each system. This approach remains sensitive to CO-dark envelopes H2 surrounding molecular clouds. In M 31, M 33, and the LMC we find alphaCO ≈ 3-9 M sun pc-2 (K km s-1)-1, consistent with the Milky Way value within the uncertainties. The two lowest metallicity galaxies in our sample, NGC 6822 and the SMC (12 + log (O/H) ≈ 8.2 and 8.0), exhibit a much higher alphaCO. Our best estimates are alphaNGC6822 CO ≈ 30 M sun pc-2 (K km s-1)-1 and alphaSMC CO ≈ 70 M sun pc-2 (K km s-1)-1. These results are consistent with the conversion factor becoming a strong function of metallicity around 12 + log (O/H) ~ 8.4-8.2. We favor an interpretation where decreased dust shielding leads to the dominance of CO-free envelopes around molecular clouds below this metallicity.},

	Abstract = {CO line emission represents the most accessible and widely used tracer of the molecular ISM. This renders the translation of observed CO intensity into total H2 gas mass critical to understanding star formation and the ISM in our Galaxy and beyond. We review the theoretical underpinning, techniques, and results of efforts to estimate this CO-to-H2 ``conversion factor,'' XCO, in different environments. In the Milky Way disk, we recommend a conversion factor of [Formula: see text] cm-2 (K km s-1)-1 with $\pm$30% uncertainty. Studies of other ``normal galaxies'' return similar values in Milky Way-like disks, but with greater scatter and systematic uncertainty. Departures from this Galactic conversion factor are both observed and expected. Dust-based determinations, theoretical arguments, and scaling relations all suggest that XCO increases with decreasing metallicity, turning up sharply below metallicity ˜1/3-1/2 solar in a manner consistent with model predictions that identify shielding as a key parameter. Based on spectral line modeling and dust observations, XCO appears to drop in the central, bright regions of some but not all galaxies, often coincident with regions of bright CO emission and high stellar surface density. This lower XCO is also present in the overwhelmingly molecular ISM of starburst galaxies, where several lines of evidence point to a lower CO-to-H2 conversion factor. At high redshift, direct evidence regarding the conversion factor remains scarce; we review what is known based on dynamical modeling and other arguments.},

@article{GonzalezDelgado.etal.2015a,
	Abstract = {Various different physical processes contribute to the star formation and stellar mass assembly histories of galaxies. One important approach to understanding the significance of these different processes on galaxy evolution is the study of the stellar population content of today's galaxies in a spatially resolved manner. The aim of this paper is to characterize in detail the radial structure of stellar population properties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on a uniquely large galaxy sample, considering the quality and coverage of the data. The sample under study was drawn from the CALIFA survey and contains 300 galaxies observed with integral field spectroscopy. These cover a wide range of Hubble types, from spheroids to spiral galaxies, while stellar masses range from M* ~ 109 to 7 × 1011 M&sun;. We apply the fossil record method based on spectral synthesis techniques to recover the following physical properties for each spatial resolution element in our target galaxies: the stellar mass surface density (mu*), stellar extinction (AV), light-weighted and mass-weighted ages (L, M), and mass-weighted metallicity (*>M). To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual radial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc, and Sd). We confirm that more massive galaxies are more compact, older, moremetal rich, and less reddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved spatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these relations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact, older, and more metal rich for a given M*, which is evidence that quenching is related to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of L are consistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest L gradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and bulges are correlated and with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late-type spirals hosting younger disks. However, age gradients are only mildly negative or flat beyond R ~ 2 HLR (half light radius), indicating that star formation is more uniformly distributed or that stellar migration is important at these distances. The gradients in stellar mass surface density depend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more centrally concentrated. Whatever sets the concentration indices of galaxies obviously depends less on quenching/morphology than on the depth of the potential well. There is a secondary correlation in the sense that at the same M* early-type galaxies have steeper gradients. The mu* gradients outside 1 HLR show no dependence on Hubble type. We find mildly negative *>M gradients, which are shallower than predicted from models of galaxy evolution in isolation. In general, metallicity gradients depend on stellar mass, and less on morphology, hinting that metallicity is affected by both - the depth of the potential well and morphology/quenching. Thus, the largest *>M gradients occur in Milky Way-like Sb-Sbc galaxies, and are similar to those measured above the Galactic disk. Sc spirals show flatter *>M gradients, possibly indicating a larger contribution from secular evolution in disks. The galaxies from the sample have decreasing-outward stellar extinction; all spirals show similar radial profiles, independent from the stellar mass, but redder than E and S0. Overall, we conclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass, while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependent processes.

@article{Stasinska.etal.2008a,
	Abstract = {The classification of galaxies as star forming or active is generally done in the ([OIII]/Hbeta, [NII]/Halpha) plane. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has revealed that, in this plane, the distribution of galaxies looks like the two wings of a seagull. Galaxies in the right wing are referred to as Seyfert/LINERs, leading to the idea that non-stellar activity in galaxies is a very common phenomenon. Here, we argue that a large fraction of the systems in the right wing could actually be galaxies which stopped forming stars. The ionization in these `retired' galaxies would be produced by hot post-asymptotic giant branch stars and white dwarfs. Our argumentation is based on a stellar population analysis of the galaxies via our STARLIGHT code and on photoionization models using the Lyman continuum radiation predicted for this population. The proportion of LINER galaxies that can be explained in such a way is, however, uncertain. We further show how observational selection effects account for the shape of the right wing. Our study suggests that nuclear activity may not be as common as thought. If retired galaxies do explain a large part of the seagull's right wing, some of the work concerning nuclear activity in galaxies, as inferred from SDSS data, will have to be revised.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the bimodal distribution of the galaxy population commonly seen in the local universe. Here, we address the bimodality observed in galaxy properties in terms of spectral synthesis products, such as mean stellar ages and stellar masses, derived from the application of this powerful method to a volume-limited sample, with magnitude limit cut-off M(r) = -20.5, containing about 50000 luminous galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2 (DR2). In addition, galaxies are classified according to their emission-line properties in three distinct spectral classes: star-forming galaxies, with young stellar populations; passive galaxies, dominated by old stellar populations; and hosts of active nuclei, which comprise a mix of young and old stellar populations. We show that the extremes of the distribution of some galaxy properties, essentially galaxy colours, 4000 {\AA} break index and mean stellar ages, are associated to star-forming galaxies at one side, and passive galaxies at another. We find that the mean light-weighted stellar age of galaxies is directly responsible for the bimodality seen in the galaxy population. The stellar mass, in this view, has an additional role since most of the star-forming galaxies present in the local universe are low-mass galaxies. Our results also give support to the existence of a `downsizing' in galaxy formation, where massive galaxies seen nowadays have stellar populations formed at early times.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the nature of starburst dust, we constructed a model of the stars and dust in starburst galaxies and applied it to 30 observed starburst spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The starburst model was constructed by combining two stellar evolutionary synthesis models with a model describing the radiative transfer of stellar photons through dust. The stellar evolutionary synthesis models were used to compute the dust-free SEDs for stellar populations with ages between 1 × 106 and 15 × 109 yr. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model, the effects of dust were computed for average Milky Way (MW) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) dust, two different star/dust geometries, and locally homogeneous or clumpy dust. Using color-color plots, the starburst model was used to interpret the behavior of 30 starbursts with aperture-matched UV and optical SEDs (and IR for 19 of the 30) from previous studies. From the color-color plots, it was evident that the dust in starbursts has an extinction curve lacking a 2175 {\AA} bump, like the SMC curve, and a steep far-UV rise, intermediate between the MW and SMC curves. The star/dust geometry that is able to explain the distribution of the 30 starbursts in various color-color plots has an inner dust-free sphere of stars surrounded by an outer star-free shell of clumpy dust. When combined with other work from the literature on the Orion region and the 30 Dor region of the Large Magellanic Cloud, this work implies a trend in dust properties with star formation intensity.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines Halpha and Hbeta is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting regions. The extinction law of the UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

	Abstract = {Far-UV spectra of seven blue compact galaxies have been obtained with the IUE satellite. These objects span a range in luminosity of -21 < M_B < -13. We have investigated their stellar content and star formation history by applying the technique of optimizing population synthesis utilizing the library of far-UV stellar spectra developed by Fanelli, O'Connell, and Thuan.  The far-UV absorption-line spectra of these galaxies are clearly composite, with the signatures of main-sequence types between O3 and mid-A. Most of the low-ionization absorption lines have a stellar origin. The Si IV and C IV features in several objects have P Cygni profiles. In Haro 1 the strength of Si IV indicates a significant blue supergiant population. The metal-poor blue compact dwarf Mrk 209 displays weak absorption lines, evidence that the stellar component has the same low metallicity as observed in the ionized gas (Z ~ 0.1 Z_sun_).  Good fits to the data are obtained with the synthesis technique. We find that the solutions yield stellar luminosity functions which display large discontinuities, indicative of discrete star formation episodes or bursts. Continuous star formation cannot account for the observations. The current burst of star formation appears to have lasted for less than 10 Myr. In all cases except Mrk 209 there is evidence of earlier star formation episodes. For Haro 2 there were at least two earlier bursts, the most recent of which ended not more than ~20 Myr ago. The A star populations in our models point to significant star formation activity 500 Myr or more ago. In the cases other than that of Haro 2, we cannot distinguish between a few isolated bursts and a continuing series of short bursts separated by ~20-30 Myr.  The amount of UV extinction is found to be low, 0.0 < E(B-V) < 0.35, significantly smaller than values derived from the Balmer decrement for the same object. The UV light preferentially emerges through windows of low optical depth. We find evidence for a positive correlation between the amount of UV extinction and the metallicity of the galaxy.  UV synthesis provides an independent estimate of the current ionizing star content which appears to be in agreement with estimates based on observations in the visible, radio, and infrared. Star formation rates can also be estimated for the hot stars detected directly in the UV, and these rates highlight the intensity of the starbursts. In the more luminous galaxies Haro 1 and Haro 15, ~3 M_sun/yr of gas is being converted into massive (m > 10 M_sun_) stars, a value independent of the nature of the initial mass function.},

	Abstract = {This work studies the relation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar-to-gas fraction in nearby galaxies. We first derive the theoretical prediction, and argue that this relation is fundamental, in the sense that it must be verified regardless of the details of the gas accretion and star formation histories. Moreover, it should hold on `local' scales, i.e. in regions of the order of 1 kpc. These predictions are then compared with a set of spectroscopic observations, including both integrated and resolved data. Although the results depend somewhat on the adopted metallicity calibration, observed galaxies are consistent with the predicted relation, imposing tight constraints on the mass-loading factor of (enriched) galactic winds. The proposed parametrization of the star fraction-metallicity relation is able to describe the observed dependence of the oxygen abundance on gas mass at fixed stellar mass. However, the `local' mass-metallicity relation also depends on the relation between stellar and gas surface densities.},

@article{Zahid.etal.2014a,
	Abstract = {We examine the mass-metallicity relation for z <~ 1.6. The mass-metallicity relation follows a steep slope with a turnover, or "knee," at stellar masses around 1010 M &sun;. At stellar masses higher than the characteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens as metallicities begin to saturate. We show that the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation depends only on the evolution of the characteristic turnover mass. The relationship between metallicity and the stellar mass normalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. We find that the redshift-independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation is set by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. The turnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygen abundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low-mass stars is an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars. The characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass, where the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is unity. Numerical modeling suggests that the relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift-independent, universal relationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. The mass-metallicity relation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio. We test the validity of this universal metallicity relation in local galaxies where stellar mass, metallicity, and gas mass measurements are available. The data are consistent with a universal metallicity relation. We derive an equation for estimating the hydrogen gas mass from measurements of stellar mass and metallicity valid for z <~ 1.6 and predict the cosmological evolution of galactic gas masses.},

	Abstract = {We present PHIBSS, the IRAM Plateau de Bure high-z blue sequence CO 3-2 survey of the molecular gas properties in massive, main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cosmic star formation peak. PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z ~ 1.2 and 2.2, with log(M *(M &sun;)) >= 10.4 and log(SFR(M &sun;/yr)) >= 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M* -SFR plane, and adopting a "Galactic" value for the CO-H2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of ~0.33 at z ~ 1.2 and ~0.47 at z ~ 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z ~ 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z = 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a ~0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes in depletion time are only a secondary effect. Since this timescale is much less than the Hubble time in all SFGs between z ~ 0 and 2, fresh gas must be supplied with a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. At given z and M *, gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The variation of sSFR between z ~ 0 and 3 is mainly controlled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas.  Based on observations with the Plateau de Bure millimetre interferometer, operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy in the Millimetre Range (IRAM), which is funded by a partnership of INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},

@article{Berta.etal.2015a,
	Abstract = {(Abridged) Combining the deepest Herschel extragalactic surveys (PEP, GOODS-H, HerMES), and Monte Carlo mock catalogs, we explore the robustness of dust mass estimates based on modeling of broad band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with two popular approaches: Draine & Li (2007, DL07) and a modified black body (MBB). As long as the observed SED extends to at least 160-200 micron in the rest frame, M(dust) can be recovered with a >3 sigma significance and without the occurrence of systematics. An average offset of a factor ~1.5 exists between DL07- and MBB-based dust masses, based on consistent dust properties. At the depth of the deepest Herschel surveys (in the GOODS-S field) it is possible to retrieve dust masses with a S/N>=3 for galaxies on the main sequence of star formation (MS) down to M(stars)~1e10 [M(sun)] up to z~1. At higher redshift (z<=2) the same result is achieved only for objects at the tip of the MS or lying above it. Molecular gas masses, obtained converting M(dust) through the metallicity-dependent gas-to-dust ratio delta(GDR), are consistent with those based on the scaling of depletion time, and on CO spectroscopy. Focusing on CO-detected galaxies at z>1, the delta(GDR) dependence on metallicity is consistent with the local relation. We combine far-IR Herschel data and sub-mm ALMA expected fluxes to study the advantages of a full SED coverage.},

@article{Leroy.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We compare molecular gas traced by 12CO (2-1) maps from the HERACLES survey, with tracers of the recent star formation rate (SFR) across 30 nearby disk galaxies. We demonstrate a first-order linear correspondence between Sigmamol and SigmaSFR but also find important second-order systematic variations in the apparent molecular gas depletion time, \tau _dep^mol = \Sigma _mol / \Sigma _SFR. At the 1 kpc common resolution of HERACLES, CO emission correlates closely with many tracers of the recent SFR. Weighting each line of sight equally, using a fixed alphaCO equivalent to the Milky Way value, our data yield a molecular gas depletion time, \tau _dep^mol=\Sigma _mol/\Sigma _SFR \approx 2.2 Gyr with 0.3 dex 1sigma scatter, in very good agreement with recent literature data. We apply a forward-modeling approach to constrain the power-law index, N, that relates the SFR surface density and the molecular gas surface density, \Sigma _SFR \propto \Sigma _mol^N. We find N = 1 $\pm$ 0.15 for our full data set with some scatter from galaxy to galaxy. This also agrees with recent work, but we caution that a power-law treatment oversimplifies the topic given that we observe correlations between \tau _dep^mol and other local and global quantities. The strongest of these are a decreased \tau _dep^mol in low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies and a correlation of the kpc-scale \tau _dep^mol with dust-to-gas ratio, D/G. These correlations can be explained by a CO-to-H2 conversion factor (alphaCO) that depends on dust shielding, and thus D/G, in the theoretically expected way. This is not a unique interpretation, but external evidence of conversion factor variations makes this the most conservative explanation of the strongest observed \tau _dep^mol trends. After applying a D/G-dependent alphaCO, some weak correlations between \tau _dep^mol and local conditions persist. In particular, we observe lower \tau _dep^mol and enhanced CO excitation associated with nuclear gas concentrations in a subset of our targets. These appear to reflect real enhancements in the rate of star formation per unit gas, and although the distribution of taudep does not appear bimodal in galaxy centers, taudep does appear multivalued at fixed SigmaH2, supporting the idea of "disk" and "starburst" modes driven by other environmental parameters.},

@article{Padoan.Haugbolle.Nordlund.2012a,
	Abstract = {We show that supersonic MHD turbulence yields a star formation rate (SFR) as low as observed in molecular clouds, for characteristic values of the free-fall time divided by the dynamical time, t ff/t dyn, the Alfv{\'e}nic Mach number, {\cal M}_a, and the sonic Mach number, {\cal M}_s. Using a very large set of deep adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations, we quantify the dependence of the SFR per free-fall time, epsilonff, on the above parameters. Our main results are (1) that epsilonff decreases exponentially with increasing t ff/t dyn, but is insensitive to changes in {\cal M}_s, for constant values of t ff/t dyn and {\cal M}_a. (2) Decreasing values of {\cal M}_a (stronger magnetic fields) reduce epsilonff, but only to a point, beyond which epsilonff increases with a further decrease of {\cal M}_a. (3) For values of {\cal M}_a characteristic of star-forming regions, epsilonff varies with {\cal M}_a by less than a factor of two. We propose a simple star formation law, based on the empirical fit to the minimum epsilonff, and depending only on t ff/t dyn: epsilonff ≈ epsilonwindexp (- 1.6 t ff/t dyn). Because it only depends on the mean gas density and rms velocity, this law is straightforward to implement in simulations and analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the radial distribution of H I gas for 23 disc galaxies with unusually high H I content from the Bluedisk sample, along with a similar-sized sample of `normal' galaxies. We propose an empirical model to fit the radial profile of the H I surface density, an exponential function with a depression near the centre. The radial H I surface density profiles are very homogeneous in the outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of the profile has a scalelength of ˜0.18 R1, where R1 is the radius where the column density of the H I is 1 M&sun; pc-2. This holds for all galaxies, independent of their stellar or H I mass. The homogenous outer profiles, combined with the limited range in H I surface density in the non-exponential inner disc, results in the well-known tight relation between H I size and H I mass. By comparing the radial profiles of the H I-rich galaxies with those of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, most of the excess gas lies outside the stellar disc, in the exponentially declining outer regions of the H I disc. In the other half, the excess is more centrally peaked. We compare our results with existing smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models of disc galaxy formation in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. Both the hydro simulations and the semi-analytic models reproduce the H I surface density profiles and the H I size-mass relation without further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. In the semi-analytic models, the universal shape of the outer H I radial profiles is a consequence of the assumption that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially.},

	Abstract = {The authors present a model of spectrophotometric evolution which predicts apparent magnitudes and colors for galaxies of the Hubble sequence at all redshifts. This model accounts for the effects of cosmology and intrinsic evolution which can thereby be separated. It includes the four main phases of stellar evolution (main sequence, giant branch, horizontal branch, and asymptotic giant branch). The library of 30 stellar spectra (from 220 {\AA} to 10,680 {\AA}) which is used for the evolutionary synthesis is basically observational, with a resolution of 10 {\AA}. The contribution of nebular emission and the effects of internal extinction are taken into account. The model gives good fits of far-UV and visible spectrophotometric properties of nearby galaxies along the Hubble sequence, by varying the timescale for the conversion of gas into stars, with uniform IMF.},

	Abstract = {Galactic scaling relations between the (surface densities of) the gas mass and the star formation (SF) rate are known to develop substantial scatter or even change form when considered below a certain spatial scale. We quantify how this behaviour should be expected due to the incomplete statistical sampling of independent star-forming regions. Other included limiting factors are the incomplete sampling of SF tracers from the stellar initial mass function and the spatial drift between gas and stars. We present a simple uncertainty principle for SF, which can be used to predict and interpret the failure of galactic SF relations on small spatial scales. This uncertainty principle explains how the scatter of SF relations depends on the spatial scale and predicts a scale-dependent bias of the gas depletion time-scale when centring an aperture on gas or SF tracer peaks. We show how the scatter and bias are sensitive to the physical size and time-scales involved in the SF process (such as its duration or the molecular cloud lifetime), and illustrate how our formalism provides a powerful tool to constrain these largely unknown quantities. Thanks to its general form, the uncertainty principle can also be applied to other astrophysical systems, e.g. addressing the time evolution of star-forming cores, protoplanetary discs or galaxies and their nuclei.},

@article{Boquien.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {Context. Understanding the relation between the attenuation and the gas is fundamental for interpreting the appearance of galaxies. This can now be done down to a local scale in the local Universe, thanks to the high spatial resolution achievable from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR). More importantly, this relation is also crucial for predicting the emission of galaxies. This is essential in semi-analytic models that link dark matter from large cosmological simulations, to the baryonic matter which we can observe directly.  Aims: The aim of the present paper is to provide new and more detailed relations at the kpc scale between the gas surface density and the face-on optical depth directly calibrated on galaxies, in order to compute the attenuation not only for semi-analytic models, but also for observational models as new and upcoming radio observatories are able to trace gas ever farther away in the Universe.  Methods: We have selected a sample of 4 nearby resolved galaxies and a sample of 27 unresolved galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey and the Very Nearby Galaxies Survey, for which we have a large set of multi-wavelength data from the FUV to the FIR including metallicity gradients for resolved galaxies, along with radio HI and CO observations. For each pixel in resolved galaxies and for each galaxy in the unresolved sample, we compute the face-on optical depth from the attenuation determined with the CIGALE spectral energy distribution fitting code and an assumed geometry. We determine the gas surface density from HI and CO observations with a metallicity-dependent XCO factor.  Results: We provide new, simple-to-use relations to determine the face-on optical depth from the gas surface density, taking the metallicity into account, which proves to be crucial for a proper estimate. The method used to determine the gas surface density or the face-on optical depth has little impact on the relations except for galaxies that have an inclination over 50$\,^{\circ}$. Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to efficiently compute the attenuation from the gas surface density taking into account possible information on the metallicity.  Conclusions: Examination of the influence of these new relations on simulated FUV and IR luminosity functions shows a clear impact compared to older, more-frequently used relations, which in turn could affect the conclusions drawn from studies based on large-scale cosmological simulations.

	Abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: What controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three questions as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

@article{Calzetti.Liu.Koda.2012a,
	Abstract = {Recent observational results indicate that the functional shape of the spatially resolved star formation-molecular gas density relation depends on the spatial scale considered. These results may indicate a fundamental role of sampling effects on scales that are typically only a few times larger than those of the largest molecular clouds. To investigate the impact of this effect, we construct simple models for the distribution of molecular clouds in a typical star-forming spiral galaxy and, assuming a power-law relation between star formation rate (SFR) and cloud mass, explore a range of input parameters. We confirm that the slope and the scatter of the simulated SFR-molecular gas surface density relation depend on the size of the sub-galactic region considered, due to stochastic sampling of the molecular cloud mass function, and the effect is larger for steeper relations between SFR and molecular gas. There is a general trend for all slope values to tend to ~unity for region sizes larger than 1-2 kpc, irrespective of the input SFR-cloud relation. The region size of 1-2 kpc corresponds to the area where the cloud mass function becomes fully sampled. We quantify the effects of selection biases in data tracing the SFR, either as thresholds (i.e., clouds smaller than a given mass value do not form stars) or as backgrounds (e.g., diffuse emission unrelated to current star formation is counted toward the SFR). Apparently discordant observational results are brought into agreement via this simple model, and the comparison of our simulations with data for a few galaxies supports a steep (>1) power-law index between SFR and molecular gas.},

The galactic infrared emission is shown to be well correlated with the H I distribution. A quantitative relation between H I column density and far-infrared surface brightness is derived. From this correlation the possible use of IRAS observations to map high galactic latitude extinction is discussed. The infrared spectrum of one diffuse H I cloud, from 12 to 100 microns is presented. Its emission in the mid-infrared (12 and 25 microns) is several orders of magnitude larger than predicted by standard dust models. The power radiated at 12 microns represents 25 percent of the 100 microns emission. The spectrum presents a minimum at 25 microns.

	Abstract = {We analyse the spectroscopic properties of thousands of H ii regions identified in 38 face-on spiral galaxies. All galaxies were observed out to 2.4 effective radii using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) over the wavelength range ~3700 to ~6900 {\AA}. The near uniform sample has been assembled from the PPAK IFS Nearby Galaxy (PINGS) survey and a sample described in Paper I. We develop a new automatic procedure to detect H ii regions, based on the contrast of the Halpha intensity maps extracted from the datacubes. Once detected, the algorithm provides us with the integrated spectra of each individual segmented region. In total, we derive good quality spectroscopic information for ~2600 independent H ii regions/complexes. This is by far the largest H ii region survey of its kind. Our selection criteria and the use of 3D spectroscopy guarantee that we cover the regions in an unbiased way. A well-tested automatic decoupling procedure has been applied to remove the underlying stellar population, deriving the main properties (intensity, dispersion and velocity) of the strongest emission lines in the considered wavelength range (covering from [O ii] lambda3727 to [S ii] lambda6731). A final catalogue of the spectroscopic properties of H ii regions has been created for each galaxy, which includes information on morphology, spiral structure, gaskinematics, and surface brightness of the underlying stellar population. In the current study, we focus on the understanding of the average properties of the H ii regions and their radial distributions. We find a significant change in the ionisation characteristics of H ii regions within r < 0.25 re due to contamination from sources with different ionising characteristics, as we discuss. We find that the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the Halpha equivalent width present a negative and positive gradient, respectively. The distribution of slopes is statistically compatible with a random Gaussian distribution around the mean value, if the radial distances are measured in units of the respective effective radius. No difference in the slope is found for galaxies of different morphologies, e.g. barred/non-barred, grand-design/flocculent. Therefore, the effective radius is a universal scale length for gradients in the evolution of galaxies. Some properties have a large variance across each object and between galaxies (e.g. electron density) without a clear characteristic value. But other properties are well described by an average value either galaxy by galaxy or among the different galaxies (e.g. dust attenuation).

	Abstract = {The main sequence (MS) of star-forming (SF) galaxies plays a fundamental role in driving galaxy evolution and our efforts to understand it. However, different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope, and shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection criteria adopted to isolate SF galaxies, which may include or exclude galaxies with a specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of SF galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-mass-number plot, the MS is then defined as the ridge line of the SF peak, as illustrated with various figures. The advantages of such a definition are manifold. If generally adopted, it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using the same SFR and stellar mass diagnostics, or it will highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All of this could help to understand MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of metallicity calibrations, AGN classification, and aperture covering fraction on the local mass-metallicity (M-Z) relation using 27,730 star-forming galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 4. We analyze the SDSS M-Z relation with 10 metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on the shape and y-intercept [12+log(O/H)] of the M-Z relation. The absolute metallicity scale (y-intercept) varies up to Delta[log(O/H)]=0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing different luminosity-metallicity or M-Z relations. We present new metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts for which different suites of emission lines are available. Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach agreement in the M-Z relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We investigate the effect of AGN classification and aperture covering fraction on the M-Z relation. We find that different AGN classification methods have negligible effect on the SDSS M-Z relation. We compare the SDSS M-Z relation with nuclear and global relations from the NFGS. The turnover of the M-Z relation at M*~1010 Msolar depends on the aperture covering fraction. We find that a lower redshift limit of z<0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiber spectra of the highest stellar mass (M*>1010 Msolar) galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and alphas for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Deltaalphas ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alphas as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making alphas slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative alpha-element abundances.

	Abstract = {Simple closed-box (CB) models of chemical evolution are extended on two respects, namely (i) simple closed-(box+reservoir) (CBR) models allowing gas outflow from the box into the reservoir (Hartwick 1976) or gas inflow into the box from the reservoir (Caimmi 2007) with rate proportional to the star formation rate, and (ii) simple multistage closed-(box+reservoir) (MCBR) models allowing different stages of evolution characterized by different inflow or outflow rates. The theoretical differential oxygen abundance distribution (TDOD) predicted by the model maintains close to a continuous broken straight line. An application is made where a fictitious sample is built up from two distinct samples of halo stars and taken as representative of the inner Galactic halo. The related empirical differential oxygen abundance distribution (EDOD) is represented, to an acceptable extent, as a continuous broken line for two viable [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations. The slopes and the intercepts of the regression lines are determined, and then used as input parameters to MCBR models. Within the errors (mpsigma), regression line slopes correspond to a large inflow during the earlier stage of evolution and to low or moderate outflow during the subsequent stages. A possible inner halo - outer (metal-poor) bulge connection is also briefly discussed. Quantitative results cannot be considered for applications to the inner Galactic halo, unless selection effects and disk contamination are removed from halo samples, and discrepancies between different oxygen abundance determination methods are explained.},

	Abstract = {We explore the gas-to-dust mass ratio (M gas/M d) and the CO luminosity-to-M gas conversion factor (alphaCO) of two well-studied galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North field that are expected to have different star-forming modes, the starburst GN20 at z = 4.05 and the normal star-forming galaxy BzK-21000 at z = 1.52. Detailed sampling is available for their Rayleigh-Jeans emission via ground-based millimeter (mm) interferometry (1.1-6.6 mm) along with Herschel PACS and SPIRE data that probe the peak of their infrared emission. Using the physically motivated Draine & Li models, as well as a modified blackbody function, we measure the dust mass (M dust) of the sources and find (2.0+0.7 -0.6 × 109) M sun for GN20 and (8.6+0.6 -0.9 × 108) M sun for BzK-21000. The addition of mm data reduces the uncertainties of the derived M dust by a factor of ~2, allowing the use of the local M gas/M d versus metallicity relation to place constraints on the alphaCO values of the two sources. For GN20 we derive a conversion factor of alphaCO < 1.0 M sun pc-2 (K km s-1)-1, consistent with that of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, while for BzK-21000 we find a considerably higher value, alphaCO ~4.0 M sun pc-2 (K km s-1)-1, in agreement with an independent kinematic derivation reported previously. The implied star formation efficiency is ~25 L sun/M sun for BzK-21000, a factor of ~5-10 lower than that of GN20. The findings for these two sources support the existence of different disk-like and starburst star formation modes in distant galaxies, although a larger sample is required to draw statistically robust results.},

	Abstract = {A simplified picture of chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood based on the instantaneous recycling approximation and incorporating the effects of recent theoretical assumptions is developed to indicate how these assumptions are related to observational constraints imposed by the dependence of stellar chemical composition on formation time as well as by the statistical distribution of metal abundances in long-lived stars such as G dwarfs. Observational data relating to these questions are reviewed, and the cumulative distribution of metal abundances in G dwarfs is derived from photometric data on nearby stars. The observed distribution is found to be approximately lognormal. Modifications of the simple model are described in detail, including prompt initial enrichment, the early version of metal-enhanced star formation, a more sophisticated version of this model, and inhomogeneous collapse and infall. It is shown that one of the two-component disk-halo models of Ostriker and Thuan (1975) is a particularly successful model.},

	Abstract = {We present an analytic formalism that describes the evolution of the stellar, gas and metal content of galaxies. It is based on the idea, inspired by hydrodynamic simulations, that galaxies live in a slowly evolving equilibrium between inflow, outflow and star formation. We argue that this formalism broadly captures the behaviour of galaxy properties evolving in simulations. The resulting equilibrium equations for the star formation rate, gas fraction and metallicity depend on three key free parameters that represent ejective feedback, preventive feedback and reaccretion of ejected material. We schematically describe how these parameters are constrained by models and observations. Galaxies perturbed off the equilibrium relations owing to inflow stochasticity tend to be driven back towards equilibrium, such that deviations in star formation rate at a given mass are correlated with gas fraction and anticorrelated with metallicity. After an early gas accumulation epoch, quiescently star-forming galaxies are expected to be in equilibrium over most of cosmic time. The equilibrium model provides a simple intuitive framework for understanding the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties, and centrally features the cycle of baryons between galaxies and surrounding gas as the driver of galaxy growth.},

@article{Lilly.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {A very simple physical model of galaxies is one in which the formation of stars is instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir with mass loss scaling with the star-formation rate (SFR). This model links together three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population: (1) the cosmic time evolution of the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relative to the growth of halos, (2) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over cosmic time, and (3) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of halos. The gas regulator is defined by the gas consumption timescale (ε-1) and the mass loading lambda of the wind outflow lambda·SFR. The simplest regulator, in which ε and lambda are constant, sets the sSFR equal to exactly the specific accretion rate of the galaxy; more realistic situations lead to an sSFR that is perturbed from this precise relation. Because the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescale on which the system evolves, the metallicity Z is set primarily by the instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history of the system. The metallicity of the gas reservoir depends on ε, lambda, and sSFR, and the regulator system therefore naturally produces a Z(m star, SFR) relation if ε and lambda depend on the stellar mass m star. Furthermore, this relation will be the same at all epochs unless the parameters ε and lambda themselves change with time. A so-called fundamental metallicity relation is naturally produced by these conditions. The overall mass-metallicity relation Z(m star) directly provides the fraction f star(m star) of incoming baryons that are being transformed into stars. The observed Z(m star) relation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies implies a strong dependence of stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint-end slopes of the stellar and halo mass functions in standard LambdaCDM models. The observed relation also boosts the sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(m star, SFR) relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(m star, SFR) data for the SDSS galaxy population, yielding ε and lambda as functions of m star. The fitted ε is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion timescales in galaxies (allowing for the extra atomic gas), while the fitted lambda is also reasonable. The gas-regulator model also successfully reproduces the Z(m star) metallicities of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. One consequence of this analysis is that it suggests that the m star-m halo relation is established by baryonic processes operating within galaxies, and that a significant fraction (40%) of baryons coming into the halos are being processed through the galaxies. This fraction may be more or less constant. The success of the gas-regulator model in simultaneously explaining many diverse observed relations over the 0 < z < 2 interval suggests that the evolution of galaxies is governed by simple physics that form the basis for this model.},

@article{Peng.Maiolino.2014a,
	Abstract = {We explore the basic parameters that drive the evolution of the fundamental properties of star-forming galaxies within the `gas regulator model', or bathtub-model. From the five basic equations of the typical gas regulator model, we derive the general analytic form of the evolution of the key galaxy properties, i.e. gas mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific SFR (sSFR), gas fraction, gas phase metallicity and stellar metallicity, without assuming that galaxies live in the equilibrium state. We find that the timescale required to reach equilibrium, taueq, which is determined by the product of star formation efficiency epsilo and mass-loading factor lambda, is the central parameter in the gas regulator model that is essentially in control of the evolution of all key galaxy properties. The scatters in most of the key scaling relations, such as the stellar mass-SFR relation and stellar mass-metallicity relation, are primarily governed by taueq. Most strikingly, the predicted sSFR evolution is controlled solely by taueq (apart from the cosmic time), independent of the gas inflow rate and of the individual values of epsilo and lambda. Although the precise evolution of the sSFR depends on taueq, the sSFR history is largely insensitive to different values of taueq. The difference between the minimum and maximum sSFR at any epoch is less than a factor of 4 for any given values of taueq. The shape of the predicted sSFR history simply mimics that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos (sMIRDM) with the typical value of the sSFR around 2 × sMIRDM. We show that the predicted sSFR from the gas regulator model is in good agreement with the predictions from typical semi-analytic models (SAMs), but both are fundamentally different from the observed sSFR history. This clearly implies that some key process is missing in both typical SAMs and gas regulator model, and we hint at some possible culprit. We emphasize the critical role of taueq in controlling the evolution of the galaxy population, especially for gas rich low-mass galaxies and dwarf galaxies that are very unlikely to live around the equilibrium state at any epoch and this has been largely ignored in many similar studies.},

	Abstract = {Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called ``strangulation'', in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 1011 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 1011 solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.},

	Abstract = {We study the baryon content of low mass galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR8), focusing on galaxies in isolated environments where the complicating physics of galaxy-galaxy interactions are minimized. We measure neutral hydrogen (HI) gas masses and line-widths for 148 isolated galaxies with stellar mass between $10^7$ and $10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$. We compare isolated low mass galaxies to more massive galaxies and galaxies in denser environments by remeasuring HI emission lines from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey 40% data release. All isolated low mass galaxies either have large atomic gas fractions or large atomic gas fractions cannot be ruled out via their upper limits. We measure a median atomic gas fraction of $f_{\rm gas} = 0.82 \pm 0.13$ for our isolated low mass sample with no systems below 0.30. At all stellar masses, the correlations between galaxy radius, baryonic mass and velocity width are not significantly affected by environment. Finally, we estimate a median baryon to total dynamical mass fraction of $f_{\rm baryon, disk} = 0.15 \pm 0.18$. We also estimate two different median baryon to halo mass fractions using the results of semi-analytic models $(f_{\rm baryon, halo} = 0.04 \pm 0.06)$ and abundance matching $(f_{\rm baryon, halo} = 0.04 \pm 0.02)$. Baryon fractions estimated directly using HI observations appear independent of environment and maximum circular velocity, while baryon fractions estimated using abundance matching show a significant depletion of baryons at low maximum circular velocities.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Second Public Data Release (DR2) of the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. The data for 200 objects are made public, including the 100 galaxies of the First Public Data Release (DR1). Data were obtained with the integral-field spectrograph PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. Two different spectral setups are available for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution V500 setup covering the wavelength range 3745-7500 {\AA} with a spectral resolution of 6.0 {\AA} (FWHM); and (ii) a medium-resolution V1200 setup covering the wavelength range 3650-4840 {\AA} with a spectral resolution of 2.3 {\AA} (FWHM). The sample covers a redshift range between 0.005 and 0.03, with a wide range of properties in the color-magnitude diagram, stellar mass, ionization conditions, and morphological types. All the cubes in the data release were reduced with the latest pipeline, which includes improvedspectrophotometric calibration, spatial registration, and spatial resolution. The spectrophotometric calibration is better than 6% and the median spatial resolution is 2.̋4. In total, the second data release contains over 1.5 million spectra.  Based on observations collected at the Centro Astron{\'o}mico Hispano Alem{\'a}n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck-Institut f{\"u}r Astronomie (MPIA) and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).The second data release is available at http://califa.caha.es/DR2},

@article{RemyRuyer.etal.2014a,
	Abstract = {Aims: The goal of this paper is to analyse the behaviour of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (G/D) of local Universe galaxies over a wide metallicity range. We especially focus on the low-metallicity part of the G/D vs metallicity relation and investigate several explanations for the observed relation and scatter.  Methods: We assembled a total of 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicity range and with 30% of the sample with 12 + log(O/H)<= 8.0. We homogeneously determined the dust masses with a semi-empirical dust model including submm constraints. The atomic and molecular gas masses have been compiled from the literature. We used two XCO scenarios to estimate the molecular gas mass: the Galactic conversion factor, XCO,MW, and a XCO that depends on the metallicity XCO,Z (∝Z-2). We modelled the observed trend of the G/D with metallicity using two simple power laws (slope of -1 and free) and a broken power law. Correlations with morphological type, stellar masses, star formation rates, and specific star formation rates are also discussed. We then compared the observed evolution of the G/D with predictions from several chemical evolution models and explored different physical explanations for the observed scatter in the G/D values.  Results: We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters, metallicity is the main physical property of the galaxy driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus metallicity relation cannot be represented by a single power law with a slope of -1 over the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for metallicities lower than ~8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D values for a given metallicity: in metallicity bins of ~0.1 dex, the dispersion around the mean value is ~0.37 dex. On average, the broken power law reproduces the observed G/D best compared to the two power laws (slope of -1 or free) and provides estimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement of observed values of the G/D and its scatter with respect to metallicity with the predicted values of the three tested chemical evolution models allows us to infer that the scatter in the relation is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting the different star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grain size distributions, and chemical compositions across the sample.  Conclusions: Our results show that the chemical evolution of low-metallicity galaxies, traced by their G/D, strongly depends on their local internal conditions and individual histories. The large scatter in the observed G/D at a given metallicity reflects the impact of various processes occurring during the evolution of a galaxy. Despite the numerous degeneracies affecting them, disentangling these various processes is now the next step.  Appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {The derivation of abundances in gaseous nebulae ionized by massive stars using optical collisionally excited emission lines is studied in this work, comparing the direct or Te method with updated grids of photoionization models covering a wide range of input conditions of O/H and N/O abundances and ionization parameter. The abundances in a large sample of compiled objects with at least one auroral line are re-derived and later compared with the chi2-weighted-mean abundances from the models. The agreement between the abundances using the two methods both for O/H and N/O is excellent with no additional assumptions about the geometry or physics governing the H II regions. Although very inaccurate model-based O/H are obtained when no auroral lines are considered, this can be overcome assuming empirical laws between O/H, log U, and N/O to constrain the considered models. In this way, for 12+log(O/H) > 8.0, a precision better than 0.1 dex consistent with the direct method is attained. For very low Z, models give higher O/H values and a high dispersion, possibly owing to the contamination of the low-excitation emission lines. However, in this regime, the auroral lines are usually well detected. The use of this procedure, in a publicly available script, HII-CHI-MISTRY, leads to the derivation of abundances in faint-/high-redshift objects consistent with the direct method based on collisionally excited lines.},

@article{Marino.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {The use of integral field spectroscopy is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxes of an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. Many studies have used these fluxes to derive the gas-phase metallicity of the galaxies by applying the so-called strong-line methods. However, the metallicity indicators that these datasets use were empirically calibrated using few direct abundance data points (Te-based measurements). Furthermore, a precise determination of the prediction intervals of these indicators is commonly lacking in these calibrations. Such limitations might lead to systematic errors in determining the gas-phase metallicity, especially at high redshift, which might have a strong impact on our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe. The main goal of this study is to review the most widely used empirical oxygen calibrations, O3N2 and N2, by using newdirect abundance measurements. We pay special attention to (1) the expected uncertainty of these calibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and (2) the presence of possible systematic offsets. This is possible thanks to the analysis of the most ambitious compilation of Te-based H ii regions to date. This new dataset compiles the Te-based abundances of 603 H ii regions extracted from the literature but also includes new measurements from the CALIFA survey. Besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gas abundance, we also present a comparison between our revisited calibrations with a total of 3423 additional CALIFA H ii complexes with abundances derived using the ONS calibration from the literature. The combined analysis of Te-based and ONS abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibration to date for both the O3N2 and N2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of all statistical significance, quality, and coverage of the parameters space. In particular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundance dependencies and statistically significant offsets compared to others'. The O3N2 and N2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygen abundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with random errors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on a large amount of data), reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex (random) and 0.02 and 0.08 dex (systematic; compared to the direct estimations), respectively.  The compiled catalog is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/559/A114Based on observations collected at the German-Spanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the Max-Planck-Institut f{\"u}r Astronomie Heidelberg and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).},

	Abstract = {Using spectra of normal emission line galaxies from the First Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we have investigated the relations between the extinction C(Hbeta) as derived from the Halpha/Hbeta emission line ratio and various global parameters of the galaxies. Our main findings are that: 1) C(Hbeta) is linked with the galaxy spectral type and colour, decreasing from early- to late-type spirals; 2) C(Hbeta) increases with increasing metallicity; 3) C(Hbeta) is larger in galaxies with an older stellar population; 4) C(Hbeta) is larger for more luminous galaxies; 5) The extinction of the stellar light is correlated with both the extinction of the nebular light and the intrinsic galaxy colours. We propose phenomenological interpretations of our empirical results. We have also cross-correlated our sample of SDSS galaxies with the IRAS data base. Due to the lower redshift limit of our sample and to the detection limit of IRAS, such a procedure selected only luminous infrared galaxies. We found that correlations that were shown by other authors to occur between optical and infrared properties of galaxies disappear when restricted the sample to luminous infrared galaxies. We also found that the optical properties of the luminous infrared galaxies in our SDSS sample are very similar to those of our entire sample of SDSS galaxies. This may be explained by the IRAS luminosity of the galaxies originating in the regions that formed massive stars less than 1 Myr ago, while the opacity of galaxies as derived from the Halpha/Hbeta emission line ratio is due to diffuse dust. We show some implications of our empirical results for the determination of global star formation rates and total stellar masses in normal galaxies.},

@article{Sanchez.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We studied the global and local M-Z relation based on the first data available from the CALIFA survey (150 galaxies). This survey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent of each galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with a resolution high enough to separate individual H II regions and/or aggregations. About 3000 individual HII regions have been detected. The spectra cover the wavelength range between [OII]3727 and [SII]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to derive the oxygen abundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. In addition, we computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surface densities) based on SDSS photometric data. We explore the relations between the stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  We derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and the gas-phase abundance, with a dispersion lower than the one already reported in the literature (sigmaDeltalog(O/H) = 0.07 dex). Indeed, this dispersion is only slightly higher than the typical error derived for our oxygen abundances. However, we found no secondary relation with the star-formation rate other than the one induced by the primary relation of this quantity with the stellar mass. The analysis for our sample of ~3000 individual HII regions confirms (i) a local mass-metallicity relation and (ii) the lack of a secondary relation with the star-formation rate. The same analysis was performed with similar results for the specific star-formation rate.  Our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, both locally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, such like that of gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. In essence, late-type/disk-dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, with a behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneous recycling/closed-box model.

	Abstract = {We present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey called MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) that began on 2014 July 1. MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 {\AA} at R ~ 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 ({\AA}-1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec-2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M * >~ 109 M &sun; using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the radial structure of the stellar mass surface density (mu*) and stellar population age as a function of the total stellar mass and morphology for a sample of 107 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We applied the fossil record method based on spectral synthesis techniques to recover the star formation history (SFH), resolved in space and time, in spheroidal and disk dominated galaxies with masses from 109 to 1012 M&sun;. We derived the half-mass radius, and we found that galaxies are on average 15% more compact in mass than in light. The ratio of half-mass radius to half-light radius (HLR) shows a dual dependence with galaxy stellar mass; it decreases with increasing mass for disk galaxies, but is almost constant in spheroidal galaxies. In terms of integrated versus spatially resolved properties, we find that the galaxy-averaged stellar population age, stellar extinction, and mu* are well represented by their values at 1 HLR. Negative radial gradients of the stellar population ages are present in most of the galaxies, supporting an inside-out formation. The larger inner (<=1 HLR) age gradients occur in the most massive (1011 M&sun;) disk galaxies that have the most prominent bulges; shallower age gradients are obtained in spheroids of similar mass. Disk and spheroidal galaxies show negative mu* gradients that steepen with stellar mass. In spheroidal galaxies, mu* saturates at a critical value (~7 × 102 M&sun;/pc2 at 1 HLR) that is independent of the galaxy mass. Thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local mu* at the same distance (in HLR units) from the nucleus. The SFH of the regions beyond 1 HLR are well correlated with their local mu*, and follow the same relation as the galaxy-averaged age and mu*; this suggests that local stellar mass surface density preserves the SFH of disks. The SFH of bulges are, however, more fundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure of the stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominated galaxies have similar radial structure in mu*. Thus, galaxy mass is a more fundamental property in spheroidal systems, while the local stellar mass surface density is more important in disks.

@article{GonzalezDelgado.etal.2014b,
	Abstract = {We use spatially and temporally resolved maps of stellar population properties of 300 galaxies from the CALIFA integral field survey to investigate how the stellar metallicity (Z sstarf) relates to the total stellar mass (M sstarf) and the local mass surface density (musstarf) in both spheroidal- and disk-dominated galaxies. The galaxies are shown to follow a clear stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) over the whole 109-1012 M &sun; range. This relation is steeper than the one derived from nebular abundances, which is similar to the flatter stellar MZR derived when we consider only young stars. We also find a strong relation between the local values of musstarf and Z sstarf (the muZR), betraying the influence of local factors in determining Z sstarf. This shows that both local (musstarf-driven) and global (M sstarf-driven) processes are important in determining metallicity in galaxies. We find that the overall balance between local and global effects varies with the location within a galaxy. In disks, musstarf regulates Z sstarf, producing a strong muZR whose amplitude is modulated by M sstarf. In spheroids it is M sstarf that dominates the physics of star formation and chemical enrichment, with musstarf playing a minor, secondary role. These findings agree with our previous analysis of the star formation histories of CALIFA galaxies, which showed that mean stellar ages are mainly governed by surface density in galaxy disks and by total mass in spheroids.},

	Abstract = {The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerated Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is a narrow band, very wide field Cosmological Survey to be carried out from the Javalambre Observatory in Spain with a purpose-built, dedicated 2.5m telescope and a 4.7 sq.deg. camera with 1.2Gpix. Starting in late 2015, J-PAS will observe 8500sq.deg. of Northern Sky and measure $0.003(1+z)$ photo-z for $9\times10^7$ LRG and ELG galaxies plus several million QSOs, sampling an effective volume of $\sim 14$ Gpc$^3$ up to $z=1.3$ and becoming the first radial BAO experiment to reach Stage IV. J-PAS will detect $7\times 10^5$ galaxy clusters and groups, setting constrains on Dark Energy which rival those obtained from its BAO measurements. Thanks to the superb characteristics of the site (seeing ~0.7 arcsec), J-PAS is expected to obtain a deep, sub-arcsec image of the Northern sky, which combined with its unique photo-z precision will produce one of the most powerful cosmological lensing surveys before the arrival of Euclid. J-PAS unprecedented spectral time domain information will enable a self-contained SN survey that, without the need for external spectroscopic follow-up, will detect, classify and measure $\sigma_z\sim 0.5\%$ redshifts for $\sim 4000$ SNeIa and $\sim 900$ core-collapse SNe. The key to the J-PAS potential is its innovative approach: a contiguous system of 54 filters with $145\AA$ width, placed $100\AA$ apart over a multi-degree FoV is a powerful "redshift machine", with the survey speed of a 4000 multiplexing low resolution spectrograph, but many times cheaper and much faster to build. The J-PAS camera is equivalent to a 4.7 sq.deg. "IFU" and it will produce a time-resolved, 3D image of the Northern Sky with a very wide range of Astrophysical applications in Galaxy Evolution, the nearby Universe and the study of resolved stellar populations.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to estimate the total gas column density, dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal ratios of distant galaxies from rest-frame optical spectra. The technique exploits the sensitivity of certain optical lines to changes in depletion of metals on to dust grains and uses photoionization models to constrain these physical ratios along with the metallicity and dust column density. We compare our gas column density estimates with H I and CO gas mass estimates in nearby galaxies to show that we recover their total gas mass surface density to within a factor of 2 up to a total surface gas mass density of ˜75 M&sun; pc-2. Our technique is independent of the conversion factor of CO to H2 and we show that a metallicity-dependent XCO is required to achieve good agreement between our measurements and that provided by CO and H I. However, we also show that our method cannot be reliably aperture corrected to total integrated gas mass. We calculate dust-to-gas ratios for all star-forming galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and show that the resulting dependence on metallicity agrees well with the trend inferred from modelling of the dust emission of nearby galaxies using far-IR data. We also present estimates of the variation of the dust-to-metal ratio with metallicity and show that this is poorly constrained at metallicities below 50 per cent solar. We conclude with a study of the inventory of gas in the central regions, defined both in terms of a fixed physical radius and as a fixed fraction of the half-light radius, of ˜70 000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that their central gas content and gas depletion time are not accurately predicted by a single parameter, but in agreement with recent studies we find that a combination of the stellar mass and some measure of central concentration provides a good predictor of gas content in galaxies. We also identify a population of galaxies with low surface densities of stars and very long gas depletion times.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR), surface density, and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy M51a (NGC 5194), using multiwavelength data obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). We introduce a new SFR index based on a linear combination of Halpha emission-line and 24 mum continuum luminosities, which provides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and SFR densities over a wide range of dust attenuations. The combination of these extinction-corrected SFR densities with aperture synthesis H I and CO maps has allowed us to probe the form of the spatially resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5-2 kpc. We find that the resolved SFR versus gas surface density relation is well represented by a Schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion to the disk-averaged Schmidt law. We observe a comparably strong correlation of the SFR surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but no significant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. The best-fitting slope of the Schmidt law varies from N=1.37 to 1.56, with zero point and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale. We tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling and averaging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. Our data can also be fitted by an alternative parameterization of the SFR surface density in terms of the ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with a considerable dispersion.},

@article{Calzetti.etal.2005a,
	Abstract = {Far-ultraviolet to far-infrared images of the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 (M51a), from a combination of space-based (Spitzer, GALEX, and Hubble Space Telescope) and ground-based data, are used to investigate local and global star formation and the impact of dust extinction. The Spitzer data provide unprecedented spatial detail in the infrared, down to sizes ~500 pc at the distance of NGC 5194. The multiwavelength set is used to trace the relatively young stellar populations, the ionized gas, and the dust absorption and emission in H II-emitting knots, over 3 orders of magnitude in wavelength range. As is common in spiral galaxies, dust extinction is high in the center of the galaxy (AV~3.5 mag), but its mean value decreases steadily as a function of galactocentric distance, as derived from both gas emission and stellar continuum properties. In the IR/UV-UV color plane, the NGC 5194 H II knots show the same trend observed for normal star-forming galaxies, having a much larger dispersion (~1 dex peak to peak) than starburst galaxies. We identify the dispersion as due to the UV emission predominantly tracing the evolved, nonionizing stellar population, up to ages ~50-100 Myr. While in starbursts the UV light traces the current star formation rate (SFR), in NGC 5194 it traces a combination of current and recent past SFRs. Possibly, mechanical feedback from supernovae is less effective at removing dust and gas from the star formation volume in normal star-forming galaxies than in starbursts because of the typically lower SFR densities in the former. The application of the starburst opacity curve for recovering the intrinsic UV emission (and deriving SFRs) in local and distant galaxies appears therefore appropriate only for SFR densities >~1 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2. Unlike the UV emission, the monochromatic 24 mum luminosity is an accurate local SFR tracer for the H II knots in NGC 5194, with a peak-to-peak dispersion of less than a factor of 3 relative to hydrogen emission line tracers; this suggests that the 24 mum emission carriers are mainly heated by the young, ionizing stars. However, preliminary results show that the ratio of the 24 mum emission to the SFR varies by a factor of a few from galaxy to galaxy; this variation needs to be understood and carefully quantified before the 24 mum luminosity can be used as an SFR tracer for galaxy populations. While also correlated with star formation, the 8 mum emission is not directly proportional to the number of ionizing photons; it is overluminous, by up to a factor of ~2, relative to the galaxy's average in weakly ionized regions and is underluminous, by up to a factor of ~3, in strongly ionized regions. This confirms earlier suggestions that the carriers of the 8 mum emission are heated by more than one mechanism.  Based on observations obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope and with GALEX.},

@article{PflammAltenburg.Weidner.Kroupa.2007a,
	Abstract = {Star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies are commonly calculated by converting the measured Halpha luminosities (LHalpha) into current SFRs. This conversion is based on a constant initial mass function (IMF) independent of the total SFR. As was recently recognized, the maximum stellar mass in a star cluster is limited by the embedded total cluster mass and, in addition, the maximum embedded star cluster mass is constrained by the current SFR. The combination of these two relations leads to an integrated galactic initial stellar mass function (IGIMF, the IMF for the whole galaxy) which is steeper in the high-mass regime than the constant canonical IMF, and is dependent on the SFR of the galaxy. Consequently, the LHalpha-SFR relation becomes nonlinear and flattens for low SFRs. Especially for dwarf galaxies, the SFRs can be underestimated by up to 3 orders of magnitude. We revise the existing linear LHalpha-SFR relations using our IGIMF notion. These are likely to lead to a revision of cosmological star formation histories. We also demonstrate that in the case of the Sculptor dwarf irregular galaxies, the IGIMF formalism implies a linear dependence of the total SFR on the total galaxy gas mass. A constant gas depletion timescale of a few Gyr results independently of the galaxy gas mass, with a reduced scatter compared to the conventional results. Our findings are qualitatively independent of the explicit choice of the IGIMF details, and challenge current star formation theory in dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Context. To derive the history of star formation in the Universe a set of calibrated star formation rate tracers at different wavelengths is required. The calibration has to consistently take into account the effects of extinction, star formation regime (short or long-lived) and the evolutionary state to avoid biases at different redshift ranges.  Aims: We use evolutionary synthesis models optimized for intense episodes of star formation to compute a consistent calibration of the most usual star formation rate tracers at different energy ranges, from X-ray to radio luminosities.  Methods: We have computed the predicted evolution of the different estimators taking into account nearly-instantaneous and continuous star formation regimes and the effect of interstellar extinction (attenuation at high energies, thermal reradiation in the far infrared). We have also considered the effect of metallicity on the calibration of the different estimators.  Results: A consistent calibration of a complete set of star formation rate tracers is presented, computed for the most usual star-forming regions conditions in terms of evolutionary state, star formation regime, interstellar extinction and initial mass function. We discuss the validity of the different tracers in different star formation scenarios and compare our predictions with previous calibrations of general use.  Conclusions: In order to measure the intensity of star formation episodes we should distinguish between nearly-instantaneous and continuous star formation regimes. While the star formation strength (M_&sun;) should be used for the former, the more common star formation rate (M_&sun; yr-1) is only valid for episodes forming stars at a constant rate during extended periods of time. Moreover, even for extended star formation episodes, the evolutionary state should be taken into account, since most SFR tracers stabilize only after 100 Myr of evolution.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities in Galactic star-forming regions using a sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) and massive dense clumps. Our YSO sample consists of objects located in 20 large molecular clouds from the Spitzer cores to disks (c2d) and Gould's Belt (GB) surveys. These data allow us to probe the regime of low-mass star formation, essentially invisible to tracers of high-mass star formation used to establish extragalactic SFR-gas relations. We estimate the gas surface density (Sigmagas) from extinction (AV ) maps and YSO SFR surface densities (SigmaSFR) from the number of YSOs, assuming a mean mass and lifetime. We also divide the clouds into evenly spaced contour levels of AV , counting only Class I and Flat spectral energy distribution YSOs, which have not yet migrated from their birthplace. For a sample of massive star-forming clumps, we derive SFRs from the total infrared luminosity and use HCN gas maps to estimate gas surface densities. We find that c2d and GB clouds lie above the extragalactic SFR-gas relations (e.g., Kennicutt-Schmidt law) by factors of up to 17. Cloud regions with high Sigmagas lie above extragalactic relations up to a factor of 54 and overlap with high-mass star-forming regions. We use 12CO and 13CO gas maps of the Perseus and Ophiuchus clouds from the COMPLETE survey to estimate gas surface densities and compare to measurements from AV maps. We find that 13CO, with the standard conversions to total gas, underestimates the AV -based mass by factors of ~4-5. 12CO may underestimate the total gas mass at Sigmagas >~ 200 M sun pc-2 by gsim30%; however, this small difference in mass estimates does not explain the large discrepancy between Galactic and extragalactic relations. We find evidence for a threshold of star formation (Sigmath) at 129 $\pm$ 14 M sun pc-2. At Sigmagas>Sigmath, the Galactic SFR-gas relation is linear. A possible reason for the difference between Galactic and extragalactic relations is that much of Sigmagas is below Sigmath in extragalactic studies, which detect all the CO-emitting gas. If the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (SigmaSFR vprop Sigma1.4 gas) and a linear relation between dense gas and star formation are assumed, the fraction of dense star-forming gas (f dense) increases as ~Sigma0.4 gas. When Sigmagas reaches ~300 Sigmath, the fraction of dense gas is ~1, creating a maximal starburst.},

@article{Kreckel.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {Dust has long been identified as a barrier to measuring inherent galaxy properties. However, the link between dust and attenuation is not straightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution. Herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the KINGFISH project allows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivity and ~1 kpc resolution. We present here new optical integral field unit spectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pc scale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in both the Balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. The stellar continuum reddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the Balmer decrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that the distribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dust content. The brightest H II regions are observed to be preferentially located in dusty regions, and we do find a correlation between the Balmer line reddening and the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation. Some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, but we also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution on scales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. We caution against the use of integrated AV measures to infer global dust properties.},

	Abstract = {Using combinations of Halpha, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) emission, we estimate the star formation rate (SFR) surface density, SigmaSFR, at 1 kpc resolution for 30 disk galaxies that are targets of the IRAM HERACLES CO survey. We present a new physically motivated IR spectral-energy-distribution-based approach to account for possible contributions to 24 mum emission not associated with recent star formation. Considering a variety of "reference" SFRs from the literature, we revisit the calibration of the 24 mum term in hybrid (UV+IR or Halpha+IR) tracers. We show that the overall calibration of this term remains uncertain at the factor of two level because of the lack of wide-field, robust reference SFR estimates. Within this uncertainty, published calibrations represent a reasonable starting point for 1 kpc-wide areas of star-forming disk galaxies, but we re-derive and refine the calibration of the IR term in these tracers to match our resolution and approach to 24 mum emission. We compare a large suite of SigmaSFR estimates and find that above SigmaSFR ~ 10-3 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2 the systematic differences among tracers are less than a factor of two across two orders of magnitude dynamic range. We caution that methodology and data both become serious issues below this level. We note from simple model considerations that when focusing on a part of a galaxy dominated by a single stellar population, the intrinsic uncertainty in Halpha- and FUV-based SFRs is ~0.3 and ~0.5 dex.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

@article{Chabrier.2003a,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

@article{Molla.2000a,
	Abstract = {We present a grid of theoretical models where the calculation of absorption line spectral indices in both the blue and red wavelength ranges is done with the same evolutionary synthesis code. We have computed some of these indices: CaT, Na i, Mg i in the near infrared and Mgb, Mg2, Fe52, Fe53, NaD and Hbeta , in the blue-visible range, for Single Stellar Population (SSP) of 6 different metallicities, (Z=0.0004, 0.001, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02 and 0.05), and ages from 4 Myr to 20 Gyr. From the comparison of these evolutionary synthesis models with a compilation of elliptical galaxy data from the literature, we find that the observed CaT index follows the blue <Fe> index rather than Mg2 as the models predict. If this implies an over-abundance [Mg/Ca] and we take into account the masses of stars which produce Mg and Ca, these stars could form in a time scale shorter than 5 Myr from the beginning of the star formation process. Alternatively, an IMF biased towards very massive stars (M> 40 Msun) at the early epoch of star formation in elliptical nuclei has to be assumed. We also suggest to revise the calculation of the nucleosynthesis yield of Magnesium. By using the diagnostic diagram CaT-Hbeta to disentangle age and metallicity in such populations, we obtain around solar abundances and a sequence of ages between 4 and 16 Gyr for the galaxy sample.

The range of initial masses goes from 0.15 Msun to 7 Msun, and the evolutionary phases extend from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) till either the thermally pulsing AGB regime or carbon ignition. We also present an additional set of models with solar composition, computed using the classical Schwarzschild criterion for convective boundaries. From all these tracks, we derive the theoretical isochrones in the Johnson-Cousins UBVRIJHK broad-band photometric system.},

@article{Stasinska.etal.2006a,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the techniques to distinguish normal star-forming (NSF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hosts using optical spectra. The observational data base is a set of 20000 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, for which we have determined the emission-line intensities after subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing radiation predicted by population synthesis codes (essentially STARBURST99) and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law spectrum. We explain why, among the four classical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, ([OIII]/Hbeta versus [OII]/Hbeta, [OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha (the BPT diagram), [OIII]/Hbeta versus [SII]/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta versus [OI]/Halpha), the BPT one works best. We show, however, that none of these diagrams is efficient in detecting AGNs in metal-poor galaxies, should such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between `pure' NSF galaxies and AGN hosts: y = (-30.787 + 1.1358x + 0.27297x2) tanh (5.7409x) - 31.093, where y = log([OIII]/Hbeta), and x = log([NII]/Halpha). According to our models, the divisory line drawn empirically by Kauffmann et al. includes among NSF galaxies objects that may have an AGN contribution to Hbeta of up to 3 per cent. The Kewley et al. line allows for an AGN contribution of roughly 20 per cent. About 20 per cent of the galaxies in our entire sample that can be represented in the BTP diagram are found between our divisory line and the Kauffmann et al. line, meaning that the local Universe contains a fair proportion of galaxies with a very low-level nuclear activity, in agreement with the statistics from observations of nuclei of nearby galaxies. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN galaxies using only [NII]/Halpha is feasible and useful.  Finally, we propose a new classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting Dn(4000) versus max(EW[OII], EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see all the galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We examined the relations between molecular gas surface density and star formation rate surface density in a 11 square degree region of the Galactic Plane. Dust continuum at 1.1 mm from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey and 22 micron emission from the WISE All-sky survey were used as tracers of molecular gas and star formation rate, respectively, across Galactic longitude of 31.5 > l > 20.5 and Galactic latitude of 0.5 > b > -0.5. The relation was studied over a range of resolutions from 33 arcsecond to 20 arcminute by convolving images to larger scales. The pixel-by-pixel correlation between 1.1 mm and 22 micron increases rapidly at small scales and levels off at the scale of 5 - 8 arcminute. We studied the star formation relation based on pixel-by-pixel analysis and 1.1 mm and 22 micron peaks analysis. The star formation relation was found to be nearly linear with no significant changes in the form of the relation across all spatial scales and lie above the extragalactic relation from Kennicutt (1998). The average gas depletion time is approximately 200 Myr and does not change significantly at different scales, but the scatter in the depletion time decreases as the scale increases.},

	Abstract = {We present ALLSMOG, the APEX Low-redshift Legacy Survey for MOlecular Gas. ALLSMOG is a survey designed to observe the CO(2-1) emission line with the APEX telescope, in a sample of local galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.03), with stellar masses in the range 8.5 < log(M*/Msun) < 10. This paper is a data release and initial analysis of the first two semesters of observations, consisting of 42 galaxies observed in CO(2-1). By combining these new CO(2-1) emission line data with archival HI data and SDSS optical spectroscopy, we compile a sample of low-mass galaxies with well defined molecular gas masses, atomic gas masses, and gas-phase metallicities. We explore scaling relations of gas fraction and gas consumption timescale, and test the extent to which our findings are dependent on a varying CO/H2 conversion factor. We find an increase in the H2/HI mass ratio with stellar mass which closely matches semi-analytic predictions. We find a mean molecular gas fraction for ALLSMOG galaxies of MH2/M* = (0.09 - 0.13), which decreases with stellar mass. We measure a mean molecular gas consumption timescale for ALLSMOG galaxies of 0.4 - 0.7 Gyr. We also confirm the non-universality of the molecular gas consumption timescale, which varies (with stellar mass) from ~100 Myr to ~2 Gyr. Importantly, we find that the trends in the H2/HI mass ratio, gas fraction, and the non-universal molecular gas consumption timescale are all robust to a range of recent metallicity-dependent CO/H2 conversion factors.},

	Abstract = {We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000 star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 Msolar h-270, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 Msolar. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the Halpha luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z~0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 Msolar. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

	Abstract = {We present a newly developed version of BayeSED, a general Bayesian approach to the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies. The new BayeSED code has been systematically tested on a mock sample of galaxies. The comparison between estimated and inputted value of the parameters show that BayeSED can recover the physical parameters of galaxies reasonably well. We then applied BayeSED to interpret the SEDs of a large Ks-selected sample of galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field with stellar population synthesis models. With the new BayeSED code, a Bayesian model comparison of stellar population synthesis models has been done for the first time. We found that the model by Bruzual & Charlot (2003), statistically speaking, has larger Bayesian evidence than the model by Maraston (2005) for the Ks-selected sample. Besides, while setting the stellar metallicity as a free parameter obviously increases the Bayesian evidence of both models, varying the IMF has a notable effect only on the Maraston (2005) model. Meanwhile, the physical parameters estimated with BayeSED are found to be generally consistent with those obtained with the popular grid-based FAST code, while the former exhibits more natural distributions. Based on the estimated physical parameters of galaxies in the sample, we qualitatively classified the galaxies in the sample into five populations that may represent galaxies at different evolution stages or in different environments. We conclude that BayeSED could be a reliable and powerful tool for investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies from the rich multi-wavelength observations currently available. A binary version of MPI parallelized BayeSED code is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/hanyk/bayesed.},

@article{Wyder.etal.2007a,
	Abstract = {We have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function of ultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. In the (NUV-r)0.1 versus Mr,0.1 galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The (NUV-r)0.1 color distribution at each Mr,0.1 is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity, with a distinct blue peak visible up to Mr,0.1~-23. The r0.1-band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint-end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one-quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust, with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low-mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of ~1010.5 Msolar, galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.},

	Abstract = {The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

@article{Vika.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate a new multiwavelength technique for two-dimensional parametric modelling of galaxy surface-brightness profiles, which we have incorporated into the widely used software GALFIT. Our new method, named GALFITM, extends GALFIT3's current single-band fitting process by simultaneously using multiple images of the same galaxy to constrain a wavelength-dependent model. Each standard profile parameter may vary as a function of wavelength, with a user-definable degree of smoothness, from constant to fully free. The performance of GALFITM is evaluated by fitting elliptical S{\'e}rsic profiles to ugriz imaging data for 4026 galaxies, comprising the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging for 163 low-redshift (v ≲ 7000 km s-1) galaxies and 3863 artificially redshifted (0.01 ≲ z ≲ 0.25) images of the same galaxies. Comparing results from single-band and multiband techniques, we show that GALFITM significantly improves the extraction of information, particularly from bands with low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. u and z SDSS bands) when combined with higher signal-to-noise images. We also study systematic trends in the recovered parameters, particularly S{\'e}rsic index, that appear when one performs measurements of the same galaxies at successively higher redshifts. We argue that it is vital that studies investigating the evolution of galaxy structure are careful to avoid or correct for these biases. The resulting multiband photometric structural parameters for our sample of 163 galaxies are provided. We demonstrate the importance of considering multiband measurements by showing that the S{\'e}rsic indices of spiral galaxies increase to redder wavelengths, as expected for composite bulge-disc systems. Finally, for the ellipticals in our sample, which should be well represented by single-S{\'e}rsic models, we compare our measured parameters to those from previous studies.},

Compared to traditional long-slit observations, the large light collecting power of 2-dimensional Integral Field Units dramatically improves the prospects for performing spectroscopy on extended low surface brightness objects with high spectral resolution. This enables us to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the outer disk of normal spiral galaxies. We describe some results from a PMAS pilot study using the existing lenslet array, and provide a basic description of the new fiber IFU-module for PMAS.},

@article{Trager.etal.2000a,
	Abstract = {This paper commences a series of investigations into the stellar populations of local elliptical galaxies as determined from their integrated spectra. The goal of the series is to determine the star formation and chemical evolution histories of present-day elliptical galaxies. The primary galaxy sample analyzed is that of Gonz{\'a}lez, which consists of 39 elliptical galaxies drawn primarily from the local field and nearby groups, plus the bulge of Messier 31. Single-burst stellar population (SSP)-equivalent ages, metallicities, and abundance ratios are derived from Hbeta, Mg b, and <Fe> line strengths using an extension of the Worthey models that incorporates nonsolar line-strength ``response functions'' by Tripicco & Bell. These functions account for changes in the Lick/IDS indices caused by nonsolar abundance ratios, allowing us to correct the Worthey models for the enhancements of Mg and other alpha-like elements relative to the Fe-peak elements. SSP-equivalent ages of the Gonz{\'a}lez elliptical galaxies are found to vary widely, 1.5 Gyr<~t<~18 Gyr, while metallicities [Z/H] and enhancement ratios [E/Fe] are strongly peaked around <[Z/H]>=+0.26 and <[E/Fe]>=+0.20 (in an aperture of radius re/8). The enhancement ratios [E/Fe] are milder than previous estimates because of the application of nonsolar abundance corrections to both Mg b and <Fe> for the first time. While [E/Fe] is usually greater than zero, it is not the ``E'' elements that are actually enhanced but rather the Fe-peak elements that are depressed; this serves not only to weaken <Fe> but also to strengthen Mg b, accounting for the overall generally mild enhancements. Based on index strengths from the Lick/IDS galaxy library (Trager et al.), C is not depressed with Fe but rather seems to be on a par with other elements such as Mg in the E group. Gradients in stellar populations within galaxies are found to be mild, with SSP-equivalent age increasing by 25%, metallicity decreasing by <[Z/H]>=0.20 dex, and [E/Fe] remaining nearly constant out to an aperture of radius re/2 for nearly all systems. Our ages have an overall zero-point uncertainty of at least ~25% because of uncertainties in the stellar evolution prescription, the oxygen abundance, the effect of [E/Fe]!=0 on the isochrones, and other unknowns. However, the relative age rankings of stellar populations should be largely unaffected by these errors. In particular, the large spread in ages appears to be real and cannot be explained by contamination of Hbeta by blue stragglers or hot horizontal-branch stars, or by fill-in of Hbeta by emission. Correlations between these derived SSP-equivalent parameters and other galaxy observables will be discussed in future papers.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Science Archive is the first in a series of multi-Terabyte digital archives in Astronomy and other data-intensive sciences. To facilitate data mining in the SDSS archive, we adapted a commercial database engine and built specialized tools on top of it. Originally we chose an object-oriented database management system due to its data organization capabilities, platform independence, query performance and conceptual fit to the data. However, after using the object database for the first couple of years of the project, it soon began to fall short in terms of its query support and data mining performance. This was as much due to the inability of the database vendor to respond our demands for features and bug fixes as it was due to their failure to keep up with the rapid improvements in hardware performance, particularly faster RAID disk systems. In the end, we were forced to abandon the object database and migrate our data to a relational database. We describe below the technical issues that we faced with the object database and how and why we migrated to relational technology.},

@article{Strauss.etal.2002a,
	Abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r<=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses mu50<=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (~0.1%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N>4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {Astronomy has evolved almost exclusively by the use of spectroscopic and imaging techniques, operated separately. With the development of modern technologies, it is possible to obtain data cubes in which one combines both techniques simultaneously, producing images with spectral resolution. To extract information from them can be quite complex, and hence the development of new methods of data analysis is desirable.  We present a method of analysis of data cube (data from single field observations, containing two spatial and one spectral dimension) that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to express the data in the form of reduced dimensionality, facilitating efficient information extraction from very large data sets. PCA transforms the system of correlated coordinates into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by principal components of decreasing variance. The new coordinates are referred to as eigenvectors, and the projections of the data on to these coordinates produce images we will call tomograms. The association of the tomograms (images) to eigenvectors (spectra) is important for the interpretation of both. The eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal, and this information is fundamental for their handling and interpretation. When the data cube shows objects that present uncorrelated physical phenomena, the eigenvector's orthogonality may be instrumental in separating and identifying them. By handling eigenvectors and tomograms, one can enhance features, extract noise, compress data, extract spectra, etc.  We applied the method, for illustration purpose only, to the central region of the low ionization nuclear emission region (LINER) galaxy NGC 4736, and demonstrate that it has a type 1 active nucleus, not known before. Furthermore, we show that it is displaced from the centre of its stellar bulge.

	Abstract = {The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (\UIT) was flown as part of the \AstroMiss\ observatory on the Space Shuttle Columbia in December 1990 and again on the Space Shuttle Endeavor in March 1995. Ultraviolet (1200-3300\AA) images of a variety of astronomical objects, with a 40\arcmin\ field of view and a resolution of about 3\arcsec, were recorded on photographic film. The data recorded during the first flight is available to the astronomical community through the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC); the data recorded during the second flight will soon be available as well. This paper discusses in detail the design, operation, data reduction, and calibration of \UIT, providing the user of the data with information for understanding and using the data. It also provides guidelines for analyzing other astronomical imagery made with image intensifiers and photographic film. (SECTION: Astronomical Instrumentation)},

	Abstract = {Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 mum), H (1.65 mum), and Ks (2.16 mum) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 sigma point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 sigma photometric uncertainty of <0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are <0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.},

@article{Schlegel.Finkbeiner.Davis.1998a,
	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mum map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mum data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mum map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected.  To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mum DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mum flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mum map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mum and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mum (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.  The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mum emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

	Abstract = {We use the UV-optical color magnitude diagram in combination with spectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the SDSS spectroscopic sample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z<0.25) and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and stellar mass (M*). Throughout this study our emphasis is on the properties of galaxies on and off of a local ``star-forming sequence.'' We discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different morphological types. We find, among other trends, that our measure of the star formation rate surface density, SigmaSFR, is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters, as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SFR/M* vs. M* space, while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SFR/M* at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SFR/M* and SigmaSFR above those on the ``star-forming sequence'' are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the ``red sequence.'' We find that this is a plausible scenario for bulge-dominated galaxies near the characteristic transition mass under reasonable assumptions regarding quenching timescales. Similarly, we use this technique to estimate the rate of mergers/starbursts that take galaxies off of the star-forming sequence and show that the implied merger rates are consistent with local measurements.},

@article{Sanchez.etal.2012a,
	Abstract = {The final product of galaxy evolution through cosmic time is the population of galaxies in the local universe. These galaxies are also those that can be studied in most detail, thus providing a stringent benchmark for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Through the huge success of spectroscopic single-fiber, statistical surveys of the Local Universe in the last decade, it has become clear, however, that an authoritative observational description of galaxies will involve measuring their spatially resolved properties over their full optical extent for a statistically significant sample. We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction. We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy. We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data. This survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of ~600 galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 < z < 0.03). CALIFA has been designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas: distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK integral field unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of ~1.3⎕', with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointing dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000 {\AA}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different resolutions: R ~ 850 and R ~ 1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey, intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfillthe expectations of the original observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory analysis: (i) the final datacubes reach a 3sigma limiting surface brightness depth of ~23.0 mag/arcsec2 for the V500 grating data (~22.8 mag/arcsec2 for V1200); (ii) about ~70% of the covered field-of-view is above this 3sigma limit; (iii) the data have a blue-to-red relative flux calibration within a few percent in most of the wavelength range; (iv) the absolute flux calibration is accurate within ~8%with respect to SDSS; (v) the measured spectral resolution is ~85 km s-1 for V1200 (~150 km s-1 for V500); (vi) the estimated accuracy of the wavelength calibration is ~5 km s-1 for the V1200 data (~10 km s-1 for the V500 data); (vii) the aperture matched CALIFA and SDSS spectra are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Finally, we show that we are able to carry out all measurements indicated above, recovering the properties of the stellar populations, the ionized gas andthe kinematics of both components. The associated maps illustrate the spatial variation of these parameters across the field, reemphasizing the redshift dependence of single aperture spectroscopic measurements. We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important resource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe.

	Abstract = {We describe the design, manufacture, commissioning, and performance of PMAS, the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer. PMAS is a dedicated integral field spectrophotometer optimized to cover the optical wavelength regime of 0.35-1 mum. It is based on the lens array-fiber bundle principle of operation. The instrument employs an all-refractive fiber spectrograph, built with CaF2 optics, to provide good transmission and high image quality over the entire nominal wavelength range. A set of user-selectable reflective gratings provides low to medium spectral resolution of approximately 1.5, 3.2, and 7 {\AA} in first order, depending on the groove density (1200, 600, 300 grooves mm-1). While the standard integral field unit (IFU) uses a 16×16 element lens array, which provides seeing-limited sampling in a relatively small field of view (FOV) in one of three magnifications (8" × 8", 12" × 12", or 16" × 16"), a recently retrofitted bare fiber bundle IFU (PPak: PMAS fiber pack) expands the FOV to a hexagonal area with a footprint of 65" × 74". Other special features include a cryogenic CCD camera for field acquisition and guiding, a nod-shuffle mode for beam switching and improved sky background subtraction, and a scanning Fabry-P{\'e}rot etalon in combination with the standard IFU (PYTHEAS mode). PMAS was initially designed and built as an experimental traveling instrument with optical interfaces to various telescopes (Calar Alto 3.5 m, ESO VLT, LBT). It is offered as a common-user instrument at Calar Alto under contract to MPIA Heidelberg since 2002.},

	Abstract = {We present the PPAK Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) Nearby Galaxies Survey (PINGS), a two-dimensional spectroscopic mosaicking of 17 nearby disc galaxies in the optical wavelength range. This project represents the first attempt to obtain continuous coverage spectra of the whole surface of a galaxy in the nearby Universe. The final data set comprises more than 50000 individual spectra, covering in total an observed area of nearly 80 arcmin2. The observations will be supplemented with broad-band and narrow-band imaging for those objects without publicly available images in order to maximize the scientific and archival values of the data set. In this paper we describe the main astrophysical issues to be addressed by the PINGS project, present the galaxy sample and explain the observing strategy, the data reduction process and all uncertainties involved. Additionally, we give some scientific highlights extracted from the first analysis of the PINGS sample. A companion paper will report on the first results obtained for NGC 628: the largest IFS survey on a single galaxy.

	Abstract = {We have used the Gemini Near-Infrared Integral-Field Spectrograph to map the age distribution of the stellar population in the inner 400 pc of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1157 (NGC 591), at a spatial resolution of 35 pc. We have performed wavelet and principal component analysis on the data in order to remove instrumental signatures. An old stellar population component (age ≳ 5 Gyr) is dominant within the inner ≈130 pc which we attribute to the galaxy bulge. Beyond this region, up to the borders of the observation field, young- to intermediate-age components (0.1-0.7 Gyr) dominate. As for Mrk 1066, previously studied by us, we find a spatial correlation between this intermediate-age component and a partial ring of low stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*). Low-sigma* nuclear rings have been observed in other active galaxies, and our results for Mrk 1157 and Mrk 1066 reveal that they are formed by intermediate-age stars. Such age is consistent with a scenario in which the origin of the low-sigma* rings is a past event which triggered an inflow of gas and formed stars which still keep the colder kinematics of the gas from which they have formed. No evidence for the presence of an unresolved featureless continuum and hot dust component - as found in Mrk1066 - is found for Mrk 1157.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional spectroscopy techniques are becoming more and more popular, producing an increasing number of large data cubes. The challenge of extracting information from these cubes requires the development of new techniques for data processing and analysis. We apply the recently developed technique of principal component analysis (PCA) tomography to a data cube from the center of the elliptical galaxy NGC 7097 and show that this technique is effective in decomposing the data into physically interpretable information. We find that the first five principal components of our data are associated with distinct physical characteristics. In particular, we detect a low-ionization nuclear-emitting region (LINER) with a weak broad component in the Balmer lines. Two images of the LINER are present in our data, one seen through a disk of gas and dust, and the other after scattering by free electrons and/or dust particles in the ionization cone. Furthermore, we extract the spectrum of the LINER, decontaminated from stellar and extended nebular emission, using only the technique of PCA tomography. We anticipate that the scattered image has polarized light due to its scattered nature.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'e}rsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 42 high-mass low-metallicity outliers from the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. These galaxies have stellar masses that span log(M sstarf/M sun) ~ 9.4 to 11.1 and are offset from the mass-metallicity relation by -0.3 to -0.85 dex in 12 + log(O/H). In general, they are extremely blue, have high star-formation rates for their masses, and are morphologically disturbed. Tidal interactions are expected to induce large-scale gas inflow to the galaxies' central regions, and we find that these galaxies' gas-phase oxygen abundances are consistent with large quantities of low-metallicity gas from large galactocentric radii diluting the central metal-rich gas. We conclude with implications for deducing gas-phase metallicities of individual galaxies based solely on their luminosities, specifically in the case of long gamma-ray burst host galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The growth of galaxies is one of the key problems in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe and its constituents. Galaxies can grow their stellar mass by accretion of halo or intergalactic gas clouds, or by merging with smaller or similar mass galaxies. The gas available translates into a rate of star formation, which controls the generation of metals in the universe. The spatially resolved history of their stellar mass assembly has not been obtained so far for any given galaxy beyond the Local Group. Here we demonstrate how massive galaxies grow their stellar mass inside-out. We report the results from the analysis of the first 105 galaxies of the largest three-dimensional spectroscopic survey to date of galaxies in the local universe (CALIFA). We apply the fossil record method of stellar population spectral synthesis to recover the spatially and time resolved star formation history of each galaxy. We show, for the first time, that the signal of downsizing is spatially preserved, with both inner and outer regions growing faster for more massive galaxies. Further, we show that the relative growth rate of the spheroidal component, nucleus, and inner galaxy, which happened 5-7 Gyr ago, shows a maximum at a critical stellar mass ~7 × 1010 M &sun;. We also find that galaxies less massive than ~1010 M &sun; show a transition to outside-in growth, thus connecting with results from resolved studies of the growth of low-mass galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalogue of galaxy photometric redshifts and k-corrections for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7), available on the World Wide Web. The photometric redshifts were estimated with an artificial neural network using five ugriz bands, concentration indices and Petrosian radii in the g and r bands. We have explored our redshift estimates with different training sets, thus concluding that the best choice for improving redshift accuracy comprises the main galaxy sample (MGS), the luminous red galaxies and the galaxies of active galactic nuclei covering the redshift range 0 < z<= 0.3. For the MGS, the photometric redshift estimates agree with the spectroscopic values within rms = 0.0227. The distribution of photometric redshifts derived in the range 0 < zphot<= 0.6 agrees well with the model predictions.  k-corrections were derived by calibration of the K-CORRECT_V4.2 code results for the MGS with the reference-frame (z= 0.1) (g-r) colours. We adopt a linear dependence of k-corrections on redshift and (g-r) colours that provide suitable distributions of luminosity and colours for galaxies up to redshift zphot= 0.6 comparable to the results in the literature. Thus, our k-correction estimate procedure is a powerful, low computational time algorithm capable of reproducing suitable results that can be used for testing galaxy properties at intermediate redshifts using the large SDSS data base.},

	Abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute the median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-{\AA}break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-{\AA}break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 109<~M*<~ 3 × 1010Msolar. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution.},

	Abstract = {Using MOPED, we determine non-parametrically the star formation and metallicity history of over 37 000 high-quality galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) early data release. We use the entire spectral range, rather than concentrating on specific features, and we estimate the complete star formation history without prior assumptions concerning its form (by constructing so-called `population boxes'). The main results of this initial study are that the star formation rate in SDSS galaxies has been in decline for ~6 Gyr; a metallicity distribution for star-forming gas, which is peaked ~3 Gyr at approximately solar metallicity, inconsistent with closed-box models, but consistent with infall models. We also determine the infall rate of gas in SDSS and show that it has been significant for the last 3 Gyr. We investigate errors using a Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recovering star formation and metallicity histories for such a large sample becomes intractable without data compression methods, particularly the exploration of the likelihood surface. By exploring the whole likelihood surface, we show that age-metallicity degeneracies are not as severe as using only a few spectral features. We find that 65 per cent of galaxies contain a significant old population (with an age of at least 8 Gyr), including recent starburst galaxies, and that over 97 per cent have some stars older than 2 Gyr. It is the first time that a complete star formation and metallicity history, without restrictive assumptions concerning its form have been derived for such a large data set of integrated stellar populations, and the first time that the past star formation history has been determined from the fossil record of the present-day spectra of galaxies.},

@article{Ocvirk.etal.2006a,
	Abstract = {We introduce STECKMAP (STEllar Content and Kinematics via Maximum A Posteriori likelihood), a method for recovering the kinematic properties of a galaxy simultaneously with its stellar content from integrated light spectra. It is an extension of STECMAP (presented recently by Ocvirk et al.) to the general case where the velocity distribution of the underlying stars is also unknown. The reconstructions of the stellar age distribution, the age-metallicity relation and the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) are all non-parametric, i.e. no specific shape is assumed. The only a priori conditions that we use are positivity and the requirement that the solution is smooth enough. The smoothness parameter can be set by generalized cross-validation according to the level of noise in the data in order to avoid overinterpretation.  We use single stellar populations (SSPs) from P{\'E}GASE-HR (R= 10000, lambda= 4000-6800 {\AA}, from Le Borgne et al.) to test the method through realistic simulations. Non-Gaussianities in LOSVDs are reliably recovered with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 20 per 0.2 {\AA}pixel. It turns out that the recovery of the stellar content is not degraded by the simultaneous recovery of the kinematic distribution, so that the resolution in age and error estimates given in Ocvirk et al. remain appropriate when used with STECKMAP.  We also explore the case of age-dependent kinematics (i.e. when each stellar component has its own LOSVD). We separate the bulge and disc components of an idealized simplified spiral galaxy in integrated light from high-quality pseudo-data (SNR = 100 per pixel, R= 10000), and constrain the kinematics (mean projected velocity, projected velocity dispersion) and age of both components.},

	Abstract = {Fundamental changes are taking place in the way we do astronomy. In twenty years time, it is likely that most astronomers will never go near a cutting-edge telescope, which will be much more efficiently operated in service mode. They will rarely analyse data, since all the leading-edge telescopes will have pipeline processors. And rather than competing to observe a particularly interesting object, astronomers will more commonly group together in large consortia to observe massive chunks of the sky in carefully designed surveys, generating petabytes of data daily. We can imagine that astronomical productivity will be higher than at any previous time. PhD students will mine enormous survey databases using sophisticated tools, cross-correlating different wavelength data over vast areas, and producing front-line astronomy results within months of starting their PhD. The expertise that now goes into planning an observation will instead be devoted to planning a foray into the databases. In effect, people will plan observations to use the Virtual Observatory. Here I examine the process of astronomical discovery, take a crystal ball to see how it might change over the next twenty years, and identify further opportunities for the future, as well as identifying pitfalls against which we must remain vigilant.},

	Abstract = {We describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the GR2 and GR3 data releases of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). These releases have identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over the GR1 data release. GALEX continues to survey the sky in the far-ultraviolet (FUV, ~154 nm) and near-ultraviolet (NUV, ~232 nm) bands, providing simultaneous imaging with a pair of photon-counting, microchannel plate, delay line readout detectors. These 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ field of view detectors are well suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent red rejection and negligible background. A dithered mode of observing and photon list output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline, entangling detector calibrations, and aspect reconstruction algorithms. Recent improvements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mAB in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We have detected a long-term drift of order 1% FUV and 6% NUV over the mission. Astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms in both bands. In this paper we provide the GALEX user with a broad overview of the calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release. Improvements are likely as the GALEX mission continues into an extended phase with a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities for guest investigations.},

	Abstract = {Here we describe the first results of the Advanced Large Homogeneous Area Medium-Band Redshift Astronomical (ALHAMBRA) survey, which provides cosmic tomography of the evolution of the contents of the universe over most of cosmic history. Our novel approach employs 20 contiguous, equal-width, medium-band filters covering from 3500 {\AA} to 9700 {\AA}, plus the standard JHKs near-infrared (NIR) bands, to observe a total area of 4 deg2 on the sky. The optical photometric system has been designed to maximize the number of objects with accurate classification by spectral energy distribution type and redshift, and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission features in the spectrum. The observations are being carried out with the Calar Alto 3.5 m telescope using the wide-field cameras in the optical, Large Area Imager for Calar Alto, and in the NIR, Omega-2000. The first data confirm that we are reaching the expected magnitude limits (for a total of 100 ks integration time per pointing) of AB <= 25 mag (for an unresolved object, signal-to-noise ratio = 5) in the optical filters from the blue to 8300 {\AA}, and from AB = 24.7 to 23.4 for the redder ones. The limit in the NIR, for a total of 15 ks exposure time per pointing, is (in the Vega system) Ks ≈ 20 mag, H≈ 21 mag, J≈ 22 mag. Some preliminary results are presented here to illustrate the capabilities of the ongoing survey. We expect to obtain accurate redshift values, Deltaz/(1 + z) <= 0.03 for about five ×105 galaxies with I <= 25 (60% completeness level), and z med = 0.74. This accuracy, together with the homogeneity of the selection function, will allow for the study of the redshift evolution of the large-scale structure, the galaxy population and its evolution with redshift, the identification of clusters of galaxies, and many other studies, without the need for any further follow-up. It will also provide targets for detailed studies with 10 m class telescopes. Given its area, spectral coverage, and its depth, apart from those main goals, the ALHAMBRA survey will also produce valuable data for galactic studies.

	Abstract = {We introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving from the blue sequence to the red sequence. We propose a simple technique for constraining this mass flux using the volume-corrected number density in the extinction-corrected UV-optical color-magnitude distribution, the stellar age indexes HdeltaA and Dn(4000), and a simple prescription for spectral evolution using a quenched star formation history. We exploit the excellent separation of red and blue sequences in the NUV-r band Hess function. The final value we measure, rhoT˙=0.033 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, is strictly speaking an upper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, and extincted galaxies. However, it compares favorably with estimates of the average mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolution derived from the DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys, rho˙R=+0.034 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3. We find that the blue sequence mass has remained roughly constant since z=1 (rhoB˙~=0.01 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, but the average on-going star formation of rho˙SF~=0.037 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 over 0<z<1 is balanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. We explore the nature of the galaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency and impact of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN fraction peaks in the transition zone. We find circumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higher luminosity AGNs.},

	Abstract = {We give an overview of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Explorer Mission launched on 2003 April 28. GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750 and 1750-2750 {\AA}). The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB~=20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB~=23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB~=25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys (R=100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0<z<2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a guest investigator program, supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey.},

	Abstract = {Context: A variety of formation scenarios have been proposed to explain the diversity of properties observed in bulges. Studying their intrinsic shape can help to constrain the dominant mechanisms at the epochs of their assembly.  Aims: The structural parameters of a magnitude-limited sample of 148 unbarred S0-Sb galaxies were derived in order to study the correlations between bulges and disks, as well as the probability distribution function of the intrinsic equatorial ellipticity of bulges. Methods: We present a new fitting algorithm (GASP2D) to perform two-dimensional photometric decomposition of the galaxy surface-brightness distribution. This was assumed to be the sum of the contribution of a bulge and disk component characterized by elliptical and concentric isophotes with constant (but possibly different) ellipticity and position angles. Bulge and disk parameters of the sample galaxies were derived from the J-band images, which were available in the Two Micron All Sky Survey. The probability distribution function of the equatorial ellipticity of the bulges was derived from the distribution of the observed ellipticities of bulges and misalignments between bulges and disks.  Results: Strong correlations between the bulge and disk parameters were found. About 80% of bulges in unbarred lenticular and early-to-intermediate spiral galaxies are not oblate but triaxial ellipsoids. Their mean axial ratio in the equatorial plane is < B/A > = 0.85. Their probability distribution function is not significantly dependent on morphology, light concentration or luminosity. The possible presence of nuclear bars does not influence our results.  Conclusions: The interplay between bulge and disk parameters favors scenarios in which bulges have assembled from mergers and/or have grown over long times through disk secular evolution. However, all these mechanisms have to be tested against the derived distribution of bulge intrinsic ellipticities.  Table 3 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ~105 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project.

	Abstract = {Context: Direct measurement of oxygen abundance for metal-rich galaxies from electron temperature is difficult or impossible since temperature-sensitive auroral lines generally become too weak to be measured.  Aims: We aim to derive the electron temperature (T_e) in the gas of metal-rich star-forming galaxies, which can be obtained from their ratios of auroral lines [O ii]lambdalambda7320, 7330 to nebular lines [O ii]lambda3727, in order to establish a more robust mass-metallicity relationship, and compare the T_e-based (O/H) abundances with those from empirical strong-line calibrations, such as R23 (=([O ii]lambda3727+[O iii]lambdalambda4959, 5007)/Hbeta).   Methods: We obtained 27 spectra by stacking the spectra of several hundred (even several thousand) star-forming galaxies selected from the SDSS-DR4 in each of the 27 stellar mass bins from log(M_*) ~ 8.0 to 10.6 (in units of log(M&sun;). This ``stack'' method sufficiently improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the auroral lines [O ii]lambdalambda7320, 7330. Using a two-zone model for the temperature structure, we derive the electron temperature t2 in the low ionization region from the [O ii]lambdalambda7320, 7330/[O ii]lambda3727 ratio, and then use a relation derived by fitting H ii region models to estimate the electron temperature t3 in the high ionization region from t_2. Then, the direct (O/H) abundances are obtained from t_2, t3 and the related line-ratios. The emission lines have been carefully corrected for dust extinction using the Balmer line ratio after correcting for the underlying stellar absorption.   Results: Combining our results with those from the literature with lower metallicities, we are able to provide a new relationship between the direct measurements of (O/H) and R23, which still shows an upper and a lower branch with the transition around 12 + log(O/H) ~ 8.0-8.2. It also shows that the empirical R23 method will overestimate log(O/H) by 0.2 to 0.6 dex. The new metal-mass relationship of the galaxies with moderate metallicities is fitted by a linear fit (12 + log(O/H) = 6.223+0.231 × log(M_*)) confirming that empirical methods significantly overestimate (O/H). We also derived their (N/O) abundance ratios on the basis of the Te method, which are consistent with the combination of the primary and secondary components of nitrogen. Conclusions: This study provides for the first time a method to calibrate direct O/H abundances (from T_e) for a large range of galaxies within a stellar mass range of ~ 5 × 108 M&sun; to 4 × 1010 M&sun;.

	Abstract = {Context: The chemical composition of the gas in galaxies over cosmic time provides a very important tool for understanding galaxy evolution. Although there are many studies at high redshift, they are rather scarce at lower redshifts. However, low redshift studies can provide important clues about the evolution of galaxies, furnishing the required link between the local and high redshift universe. In this work, we focus on the metallicity of the gas of star-forming galaxies at low redshift, looking for signs of chemical evolution.  Aims: We aim to analyze the metallicity contents star-forming galaxies of similar luminosities and masses at different redshifts. With this purpose, we present a study of the metallicity of relatively massive (log(M_star/M&sun;) ≳ 10.5) star forming galaxies from SDSS-DR5 (Sloan Digital Sky Survey-data release 5), using different redshift intervals from 0.04 to 0.4.  Methods: We used data processed with the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code, correcting the fluxes for dust extinction, estimating metallicities using the R23 method, and segregating the samples with respect to the value of the [N ii] lambda6583/[O ii] lambda3727 line ratio in order to break the R23 degeneracy selecting the upper branch. We analyze the luminosity and mass-metallicity relations, and the effect of the Sloan fiber diameter looking for possible biases.  Results: By dividing our redshift samples in intervals of similar magnitude and comparing them, significant signs of metallicity evolution are found. Metallicity correlates inversely with redshift: from redshift 0 to 0.4 a decrement of ~0.1 dex in 12 + log(O/H) is found.},

	Abstract = {Context. To understand the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is important to have a full comprehension of the role played by metallicity, star formation rate (SFR), morphology, and color. The interplay of these parameters at different redshifts will substantially affect the evolution of galaxies and, as a consequence, their evolution provides important clues and constraints for the galaxy evolution models.  Aims: In this work we focus on the evolution of the SFR, metallicity of the gas, and morphology of galaxies at low redshift in search of signs of evolution. We analyzed the evolution of the SFR, metallicity, and morphology, through the mass-metallicity, luminosity-metallicity, SFR-stellar mass, and SFR-metallicity relationships of star-forming galaxies from SDSS-DR5 (Sloan Digital Sky Survey-Data Release 5), using redshift intervals in bins of 0.1 from ~0 to 0.4.  Methods: We used data processed with the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code, correcting the fluxes for dust extinction, and estimating metallicities using the R23 method. We used the S2N2 (log(Halpha/[S ii]) vs. log(Halpha/[N ii])) diagnostic diagram as a tool to classify star-forming, composite, and AGN galaxies. We analyzed the evolution of the three principal BPT diagrams, estimating the SFR and specific SFR (SSFR) for our samples of galaxies, studying the luminosity and mass-metallicity relations, and analyzing the morphology of our sample of galaxies through the g-r color, concentration index, and SSFR.  Results: We found that the S2N2 is a reliable diagram for classifying star-forming, composite, and AGNs galaxies. We demonstrate that the three principal BPT diagrams show an evolution toward higher values of [O iii] lambda5007/Hbeta due to a metallicity decrement. We found an evolution in the mass-metallicity relation of ~0.2 dex for the redshift range 0.3 < z < 0.4 compared to our local one. From the analysis of the evolution of the SFR and SSFR as a function of the stellar mass and metallicity, we discovered a group of galaxies with higher SFR and SSFR at all redshift samples, whose morphology is consistent with those of late-type galaxies. Finally, the comparison of our local (0.04 < z < 0.1) with our higher redshift sample (0.3 < z < 0.4) shows that the metallicity, the SFR, and morphology evolve toward lower values of metallicity, higher SFRs, and late-type morphologies for the redshift range 0.3 < z < 0.4.},

	Abstract = {The Spatial Indexing used in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Science Archive divides the spherical surface into triangles in a hierarchical scheme resulting in roughly equal surface areas at each level, which is a big advantage over other schemes. The location of a point on the sky may be given by the unique index id to any level, refining it with each step. This naming scheme is being used successfully in other catalogs, too, like GSC-II and GAIA. The use of the Spatial Index in the SDSS is two-fold, a level-5 index is used to partition the bulk data, and a high-resolution level-14 index id is assigned to each data point to enable quick lookup and proximity searches. Use of this indexing scheme in more catalogs will enormously simplify cross-matching of objects. Using a new computing paradigm, we recently realized a quantum leap in performance that makes this scheme competitive with bit-interleaving and requires very little memory. The Flux-space Indexing used is a traditional k-d tree. The space is 5 dimensional, 5 being the number of SDSS-filters. The specialization to astronomical data has been achieved by modeling the location of the main branch in this space and applying the k-d tree subdivisions only to its confined area.

	Abstract = {PPak is a new fiber-based integral field unit (IFU) developed at the Astrophysical Institute of Potsdam and implemented as a module into the existing Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS) spectrograph. The purpose of PPak is to provide an extended field of view with a large light-collecting power for each spatial element, as well as an adequate spectral resolution. The PPak system consists of a fiber bundle with 331 object fibers, 36 sky fibers, and 15 calibration fibers. The object and sky fibers collect the light from the focal plane behind a focal reducer lens. The object fibers of PPak, each 2.7" in diameter, provide a contiguous hexagonal field of view of 74" × 64" on the sky, with a filling factor of 60%. The operational wavelength range is from 400 to 900 nm. The PPak IFU, together with the PMAS spectrograph, are intended for the study of extended, low surface brightness objects, offering an optimization of total light-collecting power and spectral resolution. This paper describes the instrument design, the assembly, integration, and tests, the commissioning and operational procedures, and presents the measured performance at the telescope.},

	Abstract = {We study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size and internal structure for a complete sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that low-redshift galaxies divide into two distinct families at a stellar mass of 3 × 1010 Msolar. Lower-mass galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low concentrations typical of discs. Their star formation histories are more strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion sigma(lnR50) ~ 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as mu*~M0.54*, suggesting that the stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above 3 × 1010 Msolar, there is a rapidly increasing fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution remains lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing mass and the median stellar mass surface density is approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in massive galaxies after they have assembled.},

@article{Johnston.etal.2012a,
	Abstract = {A new method for spectroscopic bulge-disc decomposition is presented, in which the spatial light profile in a two-dimensional spectrum is decomposed wavelength by wavelength into bulge and disc components, allowing separate one-dimensional spectra for each component to be constructed. This method has been applied to observations of a sample of nine lenticular galaxies (S0s) in the Fornax Cluster in order to obtain clean high-quality spectra of their individual bulge and disc components. So far this decomposition has only been fully successful when applied to galaxies with clean light profiles, without contamination from dust lanes, etc. This has consequently limited the number of galaxies that could be separated into bulge and disc components. The Lick index stellar population analysis of the component spectra reveals that in those galaxies where the bulge and disc could be distinguished, the bulges have systematically higher metallicities and younger stellar populations than the discs. This correlation is consistent with a picture in which S0 formation comprises the shutting down of star formation in the disc accompanied by a final burst of star formation in the bulge. Similarly, a trend was found to exist whereby galaxies with younger stellar populations have higher metallicities. The variation in spatial-fit parameters with wavelength also allows us to measure approximate colour gradients in the individual components. Such gradients were detected separately in both bulges and discs, in the sense that redder light is systematically more centrally concentrated in all components. However, a search for radial variations in the absorption line strengths determined for the individual components revealed that, although they can be sensitively detected where present, they are absent from the vast majority of S0 discs and bulges. The absence of gradients in line indices for most galaxies implies that the colour gradient cannot be attributed to age or metallicity variations and is therefore most likely associated with varying degrees of obscuration by dust.},

	Abstract = {We describe the most ambitious survey currently planned in the visible band, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky that is visible from Cerro Pachon in Northern Chile. The current baseline design, with an 8.4m (6.5m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 sq. deg. field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera, will allow about 10,000 sq.deg. of sky to be covered using pairs of 15-second exposures twice per night every three nights on average, with typical 5-sigma depth for point sources of r=24.5. The system is designed to yield high image quality as well as superb astrometric and photometric accuracy. The total survey area will include 30,000 sq.deg. with delta<+34.5, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, ugrizy, covering the wavelength range 320-1050 nm. The project is scheduled to begin the regular survey operations before the end of this decade. About 90% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 sq.deg. region about 1000 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to r=27.5. These data will result in databases including 10 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and will serve the majority of science programs. (abridged)},

@article{IglesiasParamo.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {This work investigates the effect of the aperture size on derived galaxy properties for which we have spatially-resolved optical spectra. We focus on some indicators of star formation activity and dust attenuation for spiral galaxies that have been widely used in previous work on galaxy evolution. We investigated 104 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey for which 2D spectroscopy with complete spatial coverage is available. From the 3D cubes we derived growth curves of the most conspicuous Balmer emission lines (Halpha, Hbeta) for circular apertures of different radii centered at the galaxy's nucleus after removing the underlying stellar continuum. We find that the Halpha flux (f(Halpha)) growth curve follows a well-defined sequence with aperture radius that shows a low dispersion around the median value. From this analysis, we derived aperture corrections for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift intervals. Once stellar absorption is properly accounted for, the f(Halpha)/f(Hbeta) ratio growth curve shows a smooth decline, pointing toward the absence of differential dust attenuation as a function of radius. Aperture corrections as a function of the radius are provided in the interval [0.3, 2.5]R50. Finally, the Halpha equivalent-width (EW(Halpha)) growth curve increases with the size of the aperture and shows a very high dispersion for small apertures. This prevents us from using reliable aperture corrections for this quantity. In addition, this result suggests that separating star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on observed EW(Halpha) through small apertures will probably result in low EW(Halpha) star-forming galaxies begin classified as quiescent.},

	Abstract = {We present the first public data release (DR1) of the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. It consists of science-grade optical datacubes for the first 100 of eventually 600 nearby (0.005 < z < 0.03) galaxies, obtained with the integral-field spectrograph PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. The galaxies in DR1 already cover a wide range of properties in color-magnitude space, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionization conditions. This offers the potential to tackle a variety of open questions in galaxy evolution using spatially resolved spectroscopy. Two different spectral setups are available for each galaxy, (i) a low-resolution V500 setup covering the nominal wavelength range 3745-7500 {\AA} with a spectral resolution of 6.0 {\AA} (FWHM), and (ii) a medium-resolution V1200 setup covering the nominal wavelength range 3650-4840 {\AA} with a spectral resolution of 2.3 {\AA} (FWHM). We present the characteristics and data structure of the CALIFA datasets that should be taken into account for scientific exploitation of the data, in particular the effects of vignetting, bad pixels and spatially correlated noise. The data quality test for all 100 galaxies showed that we reach a median limiting continuum sensitivity of 1.0 × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1 arcsec-2 at 5635 {\AA} and 2.2 × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1 arcsec-2 at 4500 {\AA} for the V500 and V1200 setup respectively, which corresponds to limiting r and g band surface brightnesses of 23.6 mag arcsec-2 and 23.4 mag arcsec-2, or an unresolved emission-line flux detection limit of roughly 1 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2 and 0.6 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, respectively. The median spatial resolution is 3farcs7, and the absolute spectrophotometric calibration is better than 15% (1sigma). We also describe the available interfaces and tools that allow easy access to this first publicCALIFA data at http://califa.caha.es/DR1  Based on observations collected at the Centro Astron{\'o}mico Hispano Alem{\'a}n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max- Planck-Institut f{\"u}r Astronomie (MPIA) and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).},

@article{Haussler.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate a new method for fitting galaxy profiles which makes use of the full multiwavelength data provided by modern large optical-near-infrared imaging surveys. We present a new version of GALAPAGOS, which utilizes a recently developed multiwavelength version of GALFIT, and enables the automated measurement of wavelength-dependent S{\'e}rsic profile parameters for very large samples of galaxies. Our new technique is extensively tested to assess the reliability of both pieces of software, GALFIT and GALAPAGOS on both real ugrizY JHK imaging data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey and simulated data made to the same specifications. We find that fitting galaxy light profiles with multiwavelength data increases the stability and accuracy of the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningful multiwavelength photometry than has been available previously. The improvement is particularly significant for magnitudes in low-S/N bands and for structural parameters like half-light radius re and S{\'e}rsic index n for which a prior is used by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function of wavelength. This allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxies for which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. The technique utilizes a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creating more physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allows accurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-frame values.},

	Abstract = {Early results are reported from the SAURON survey of the kinematics and stellar populations of a representative sample of nearby E, S0 and Sa galaxies. The survey is aimed at determining the intrinsic shape of the galaxies, their orbital structure, the mass-to-light ratio as a function of radius, the age and metallicity of the stellar populations, and the frequency of kinematically decoupled cores and nuclear black holes. The construction of the representative sample is described, and its properties are illustrated. A comparison with long-slit spectroscopic data establishes that the SAURON measurements are comparable to, or better than, the highest-quality determinations. Comparisons are presented for NGC 3384 and 4365, where stellar velocities and velocity dispersions are determined to a precision of 6kms-1, and the h3 and h4 parameters of the line-of-sight velocity distribution to a precision of better than 0.02. Extraction of accurate gas emission-line intensities, velocities and linewidths from the data cubes is illustrated for NGC 5813. Comparisons with published line strengths for NGC 3384 and 5813 reveal uncertainties of <~0.1{\AA} on the measurements of the Hbeta, Mg b and Fe5270 indices. Integral-field mapping uniquely connects measurements of the kinematics and stellar populations to the galaxy morphology. The maps presented here illustrate the rich stellar kinematics, gaseous kinematics, and line-strength distributions of early-type galaxies. The results include the discovery of a thin, edge-on, disc in NGC 3623, confirm the axisymmetric shape of the central region of M32, illustrate the LINER nucleus and surrounding counter-rotating star-forming ring in NGC 7742, and suggest a uniform stellar population in the decoupled core galaxy NGC 5813.},

	Abstract = {We present BUDDA (Bulge/Disk Decomposition Analysis), a new code devoted to perform a two-dimensional bulge/disk decomposition directly from the images of galaxies. The bulge component is fitted with a generalized S{\'e}rsic profile, whereas disks have an exponential profile. No other components are included. Bars and other substructures, like lenses, rings, inner bars, and inner disks, are studied with the residual images obtained through the subtraction of bulges and disks from the original images. This means that a detailed structural analysis of galaxies may be performed with a small number of parameters, and substructures may be directly studied with no a priori assumptions. As has been already shown by several studies, two-dimensional fitting is much more reliable than one-dimensional profile fitting. Moreover, our code has been thoroughly tested with artificial data, and we demonstrate it to be an accurate tool for determining structural parameters of galaxies. We also show that our code is useful in various kinds of studies, including galaxies of, e.g., different morphological types, and inclinations, which also may be observed at different spatial resolutions. Thus, the code has a broader range of potential applications than most of the previous codes, which are developed to tackle specific problems. To illustrate its usefulness, we present the results obtained with a sample of 51 mostly early-type galaxies (but covering the whole Hubble sequence). These results show some of the applications in which the code may be used: the determination of parameters for fundamental plane and structural studies, quantitative morphological classification of galaxies, and the identification and study of hidden substructures. We have determined the structural parameters of the galaxies in our sample and found many examples of hidden inner disks in ellipticals, secondary bars, nuclear rings and dust lanes in lenticulars and spirals, and also wrong morphological classification cases. We now make BUDDA generally available to the astronomical community.  Based on observations made at the Pico dos Dias Observatory (PDO/LNA-CNPq), Brazil.},

The sample consists of 2028 galaxies in an area of 1.75 sr with declination south of -17$\,^{\circ}$.5 and galactic latitude below -30$\,^{\circ}$. The sample diameter is limited with all galaxies having log [D(0)] greater than 0.1 where D(0) is a "face-on" diameter in arcminutes. The redshift sample is not complete at the smallest diameter, particularly for the later type galaxies, for which the surface brightness is very low; redshifts are available for 1657 of the galaxies. This survey provides useful information on large-scale structure to a depth of 120 h-1Mpc (H0 = 100h km s-1Mpc-1).},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate a novel technology that combines the power of the multi-object spectrograph with the spatial multiplex advantage of an integral field spectrograph (IFS). The Sydney-AAO (Australian Astronomical Observatory) Multi-object IFS (SAMI) is a prototype wide-field system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) that allows 13 imaging fibre bundles ('hexabundles') to be deployed over a 1-degree diameter field of view. Each hexabundle comprises 61 lightly fused multi-mode fibres with reduced cladding and yields a 75 per cent filling factor. Each fibre core diameter subtends 1.6 arcsec on the sky and each hexabundle has a field of view of 15 arcsec diameter. The fibres are fed to the flexible AAOmega double-beam spectrograph, which can be used at a range of spectral resolutions (R=lambda/deltalambda≈ 1700-13 000) over the optical spectrum (3700-9500 {\AA}). We present the first spectroscopic results obtained with SAMI for a sample of galaxies at z≈ 0.05.

	Abstract = {Massive spectroscopic surveys like the SDSS have revolutionized the way we study AGN and their relations to the galaxies they live in. A first step in any such study is to define samples of different types of AGN on the basis of emission-line ratios. This deceivingly simple step involves decisions on which classification scheme to use and data quality censorship. Galaxies with weak emission lines are often left aside or dealt with separetely because one cannot fully classify them onto the standard star-forming, Seyfert, or LINER categories. This contribution summarizes alternative classification schemes which include this very numerous population. We then study how star-formation histories and physical properties of the hosts vary from class to class, and present compelling evidence that the emission lines in the majority of LINER-like systems in the SDSS are not powered by black-hole accretion. The data are fully consistent with them being galaxies whose old stars provide all the ionizing power needed to explain their line ratios and luminosities. Such retired galaxies deserve a place in the emission-line taxonomy.},

	Abstract = {We use the WHalpha versus [N II]/Halpha (WHAN) diagram introduced by us in previous work to provide a comprehensive emission-line classification of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. This classification is able to cope with the large population of weak line galaxies that do not appear in traditional diagrams due to a lack of some of the diagnostic lines. A further advantage of the WHAN diagram is to allow the differentiation between two very distinct classes that overlap in the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) region of traditional diagnostic diagrams. These are galaxies hosting a weakly active galactic nucleus (wAGN) and 'retired galaxies' (RGs), i.e. galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their hot low-mass evolved stars.  A useful criterion to distinguish true from fake AGN (i.e. the RGs) is the value of xi, which measures the ratio of the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosity with respect to the Halpha luminosity expected from photoionization by stellar populations older than 108 yr. We find that xi follows a markedly bimodal distribution, with a xi≫ 1 population composed by systems undergoing star formation and/or nuclear activity, and a peak at xi˜ 1 corresponding to the prediction of the RG model. We base our classification scheme not on xi but on a more readily available and model-independent quantity which provides an excellent observational proxy for xi: the equivalent width of Halpha. Based on the bimodal distribution of WHalpha, we set the practical division between wAGN and RGs at WHalpha= 3 {\AA}.  Five classes of galaxies are identified within the WHAN diagram:  (i) pure star-forming galaxies: ? and WHalpha > 3 {\AA};  (ii) strong AGN (i.e. Seyferts): ? and WHalpha > 6 {\AA};  (iii) weak AGN: ? and WHalpha between 3 and 6 {\AA};  (iv) RGs (i.e. fake AGN): WHalpha < 3 {\AA};  (v) passive galaxies (actually, lineless galaxies): WHalpha and W[N II] < 0.5 {\AA}.  A comparative analysis of star formation histories and of other physical and observational properties in these different classes of galaxies corroborates our proposed differentiation between RGs and wAGN in the LINER-like family. This analysis also shows similarities between strong and weak AGN on the one hand, and retired and passive galaxies on the other.},

@article{CidFernandes.etal.2013a,
	Abstract = {Aims: Fossil record methods based on spectral synthesis techniques have matured during the past decade, and their application to integrated galaxy spectra has fostered substantial advances in the understanding of galaxies and their evolution. Yet, because of the lack of spatial resolution, these studies are limited to a global view, providing no information about the internal physics of galaxies.  Methods: Motivated by the CALIFA survey, which is gathering integral field spectroscopy (IFS) over the full optical extent of 600 galaxies, we have developed an end-to-end pipeline that: (i) partitions the observed datacube into Voronoi zones in order to, when necessary and taking due account of correlated errors, increase the signal-to-noise ratio; (ii) extracts rest-framed spectra, including propagated errors and bad-pixel flags; (iii) feeds the spectra into the starlight spectral synthesis code; (iv) packs the results for all galaxy zones into a single FITS or HDF5 file; (v) performs a series of post-processing operations, including zone-to-pixel image reconstruction and unpacking the spectral and stellar population properties derived by starlight into multidimensional time, metallicity, and spatial coordinates. This paper provides an illustrated description of the whole pipeline and its many products. Using data for the nearby spiral NGC 2916 as a showcase, we go through each of the steps involved and present a series of ways of visualizing and analyzing this manifold. These include 2D maps of properties such as the velocity field, stellar extinction, mean ages and metallicities, mass surface densities, and star formation rates on different time scales and normalized in different ways, as well as 1D averages in the temporal and spatial dimensions, which lead to evolutionary curves and radial profiles of physical properties. Projections of the stellar light and mass growth onto radius-age diagrams are introduced as a means of visualizing galaxy evolution in time and space simultaneously, something which can also be achieved in 3D with snapshot cuts through the (x,y,t) cubes.  Results: The results vividly illustrate the richness both of the combination of IFS data with spectral synthesis and of the insights on galaxy physics provided by the variety of diagnostics and semi-empirical constraints obtained. Additionally, they give a glimpse of what is to come from CALIFA and future IFS surveys.},

	Abstract = {We explore the mass-assembly and chemical enrichment histories of star-forming galaxies by applying a population synthesis method to a sample of 84828 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5. Our method decomposes the entire observed spectrum in terms of a sum of simple stellar populations spanning a wide range of ages and metallicities, thus allowing the reconstruction of galaxy histories. A comparative study of galaxy evolution is presented, where galaxies are grouped on to bins of nebular abundances or mass. We find that galaxies whose warm interstellar medium is poor in heavy elements are slow in forming stars. Their stellar metallicities also rise slowly with time, reaching their current values (Z* ~ 1/3Zsolar) in the last ~100 Myr of evolution. Systems with metal-rich nebulae, on the other hand, assembled most of their mass and completed their chemical evolution long ago, reaching Z* ~ Zsolar at lookback times of several Gyr. These same trends, which are ultimately a consequence of galaxy downsizing, appear when galaxies are grouped according to their stellar mass. The reconstruction of galaxy histories to this level of detail out of integrated spectra offers promising prospects in the field of galaxy evolution theories.},

	Abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual & Charlot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 {\AA} range. The reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1) simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain) strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular, we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios.  We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50362 galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000-{\AA} break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion.},

@article{CidFernandes.etal.2004a,
	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study of the stellar populations of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). Our main goal is to determine whether the stars that live in the innermost (100 pc scale) regions of these galaxies are in some way related to the emission-line properties, which would imply a link between the stellar population and the ionization mechanism. High signal-to-noise ratio, ground-based long-slit spectra in the 3500-5500 {\AA} interval were collected for 60 galaxies: 51 LINERs and LINER/H II transition objects, two starburst galaxies, and seven nonactive galaxies. In this paper, the first of a series, we (1) describe the sample; (2) present the nuclear spectra; (3) characterize the stellar populations of LLAGNs by means of an empirical comparison with normal galaxies; (4) measure a set of spectral indices, including several absorption-line equivalent widths and colors indicative of stellar populations; and (5) correlate the stellar indices with emission-line ratios that may distinguish between possible excitation sources for the gas. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Few LLAGNs have a detectable young (<~107 yr) starburst component, indicating that very massive stars do not contribute significantly to the optical continuum. In particular, no features due to Wolf-Rayet stars were convincingly detected. (2) High-order Balmer absorption lines of H I (HOBLs), on the other hand, are detected in ~40% of LLAGNs. These features, which are strongest in 108-109 yr intermediate-age stellar populations, are accompanied by diluted metal absorption lines and bluer colors than other objects in the sample. (3) These intermediate-age populations are very common (~50%) in LLAGNs with relatively weak [O I] emission ([OI]/Halpha<=0.25) but rare (~10%) in LLAGNs with stronger [O I]. This is intriguing since LLAGNs with weak [O I] have been previously hypothesized to be ``transition objects'' in which both an AGN and young stars contribute to the emission-line excitation. Massive stars, if present, are completely outshone by intermediate-age and old stars in the optical. This happens in at least a couple of objects where independent UV spectroscopy detects young starbursts not seen in the optical. (4) Objects with predominantly old stars span the whole range of [O I]/Halpha values, but (5) sources with significant young and/or intermediate-age populations are nearly all (~90%) weak-[O I] emitters. These new findings suggest a link between the stellar populations and the gas ionization mechanism. The strong-[O I] objects are most likely true LLAGNs, with stellar processes being insignificant. However, the weak-[O I] objects may comprise two populations, one where the ionization is dominated by stellar processes and another where it is governed by either an AGN or a more even mixture of stellar and AGN processes. Possible stellar sources for the ionization include weak starbursts, supernova remnants, and evolved poststarburst populations. These scenarios are examined and constrained by means of complementary observations and detailed modeling of the stellar populations in forthcoming communications.

	Abstract = {Aims: In a companion paper we have presented many products derived from the application of the spectral synthesis code starlight to datacubes from the CALIFA survey, including 2D maps of stellar population properties (such as mean ages, mass, and extinction) and 1D averages in the temporal and spatial dimensions. Our goal here is to assess the uncertainties in these products.  Methods: Uncertainties associated to noise and spectral shape calibration errors in the data and to the synthesis method were investigated by means of a suite of simulations, perturbing spectra and processing them through our analysis pipelines. The simulations used 1638 CALIFA spectra for NGC 2916, with perturbation amplitudes gauged in terms of the expected errors. A separate study was conducted to assess uncertainties related to the choice of evolutionary synthesis models, the key ingredient in the translation of spectroscopic information into stellar population properties. We compare the results obtained with three different sets of models: the traditional Bruzual & Charlot models, a preliminary update of them, and a combination of spectra derived from the Granada and MILES models. About 105 spectra from over 100 CALIFA galaxies were used in this comparison.  Results: Noise and shape-related errors at the level expected for CALIFA propagate to uncertainties of 0.10-0.15 dex in stellar masses, mean ages, and metallicities. Uncertainties in AV increase from 0.06 mag for random noise to 0.16 mag for spectral shape errors. Higher-order products such as star formation histories are more uncertain than global properties, but still relatively stable. Owing to the large number statistics of datacubes, spatial averaging reduces uncertainties while preserving information on the history and structure of stellar populations. Radial profiles of global properties, and star formation histories averaged over different regions are much more stable than those obtained for individual spaxels. Uncertainties related to the choice of base models are larger than those associated with data and method. Except for metallicities, which come out very different when fits are performed with the Bruzual & Charlot models, differences in mean age, mass, and metallicity are of the order of 0.15 to 0.25 dex, and 0.1 mag for AV. Spectral residuals are of the order of 1% on average, but with systematic features of up to 4% amplitude. We discuss the origin of these features, most of which are present in both in CALIFA and SDSS spectra.},

	Abstract = {The bimodal galaxy distribution in the optical colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) comprises a narrow 'red sequence' populated mostly by early-type galaxies and a broad 'blue cloud' dominated by star-forming systems. Although the optical CMD allows one to select red sequence objects, neither can it be used for galaxy classification without additional observational data such as spectra or high-resolution images, nor to identify blue galaxies at unknown redshifts. We show that adding the near ultraviolet (NUV) colour [Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) NUV lambdaeff= 227 nm] to the optical (g - r versus Mr) CMD reveals a tight relation in the 3D colour-colour-magnitude space smoothly continuing from the 'blue cloud' to the 'red sequence'. We found that 98 per cent of 225 000 low-redshift (Z < 0.27) galaxies follow a smooth surface ? with a standard deviation of 0.03-0.07 mag making it the tightest known galaxy photometric relation, given the ˜0.9 mag range of k-corrected g - r colours. Similar relations exist in other NUV-optical colours. There is a strong correlation between morphological types and integrated ? colours of galaxies, while the connection with g - r is ambiguous. Rare galaxy classes such as E+A or tidally stripped systems become outliers that occupy distinct regions in the 3D parameter space. Using stellar population models for galaxies with different star formation histories, we show that (a) the (?) distribution at a given luminosity is formed by objects having constant and exponentially declining star formation rates with different characteristic time-scales with the red sequence part consistent also with simple stellar population; (b) colour evolution for exponentially declining models goes along the relation suggesting a weak evolution of its shape up to a redshift of 0.9; (c) galaxies with truncated star formation histories have very short transition phase offset from the relation thus explaining the rareness of E+A galaxies. This relation can be used as a powerful galaxy classification tool when morphology remains unresolved. Its mathematical consequence is the possibility of precise and simple redshift estimates from only three broad-band photometric points. We show that this simple approach being applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey and GALEX data works better than most existing photometric redshift techniques applied to multicolour data sets. Therefore, the relation can be used as an efficient search technique for galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.3 < Z < 0.8) using optical imaging surveys. <title type="main">Footnotes<label>1</label>  <label>2</label>  <label>3</label>  <label>4</label>},

	Abstract = {We use principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate stellar masses, mean stellar ages, star formation histories (SFHs), dust extinctions and stellar velocity dispersions for a set of ˜290 000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 1011 M&sun; and redshifts in the range 0.4 < z < 0.7 from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We find that the fraction of galaxies with active star formation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens above a stellar mass of 1011.5 M&sun; at z˜ 0.6. This is in striking contrast to z˜ 0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declines monotonically with stellar mass. At stellar masses of 1012 M&sun;, therefore, the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z˜ 0.6 to the present day reaches a factor of ˜10. When we stack the spectra of the most massive, star-forming galaxies at z˜ 0.6, we find that half of their [O III] emission is produced by active galactic nuclei. The black holes in these galaxies are accreting on average at ˜0.01 the Eddington rate. To obtain these results, we use the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual & Charlot to generate a library of model spectra with a broad range of SFHs, metallicities, dust extinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. The PCA is run on this library to identify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range 3700-5500 {\AA}. We demonstrate that linear combinations of these components can recover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the 4000-{\AA} break strength and HdeltaA, with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In addition, the method is able to recover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellar age, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low S/N BOSS spectra. We examine in detail the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the input parameters in our model library, showing that almost all changes result in systematic differences in logM* of 0.1 dex or less. The biggest differences are obtained when using different population synthesis models - stellar masses derived using Maraston et al. models are systematically smaller by up to 0.12 dex at young ages.},

	Abstract = {The parameterized extinction data of Fitzpatrick and Massa (1986, 1988) for the ultraviolet and various sources for the optical and near-infrared are used to derive a meaningful average extinction law over the 3.5 micron to 0.125 wavelength range which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium. The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

Our Bayesian approach, symmetric in all observations, is the foundation of a unified framework for object matching, where not only spatial information, but also physical properties, such as colors, redshift, and luminosity, can be considered in a natural way. We provide a practical recipe to implement an efficient recursive algorithm to evaluate the Bayes factor over a set of catalogs with known circular errors in positions.

We introduce the concept of primaries to resolve the issue of multiple detections and follow a geometric approach to define clean catalogs with well understood selection functions. We cross-identify the GALEX sources (GR2+3) with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; DR6) observations, which indirectly provides an invaluable insight into the astrometric model of the UV sources and allows us to revise the band merging strategy. We derive the formal description of the GALEX footprints as well as their intersections with the SDSS coverage along with analytic calculations of their areal coverage. The crossmatch catalogs are made available for the public. We conclude by illustrating the implementation of typical selection criteria in SQL for catalog subsets geared toward statistical analyses, e.g., correlation and luminosity function studies.},

Different choices of the initial mass function and the star formation rate allow the construction of models which at the present epoch cover the range of observed galaxy spectra. Special emphasis is given to the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Ultraviolet spectra of late-type stars and early-type galaxies obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite are used in this work. The evolving spectral energy distributions are used to compute galaxy colors, magnitudes, K-corrections, and evolutionary corrections as functions of redshift for different photometric systems.},

	Abstract = {In 1992 March the Far Ultraviolet Space Telescope was flown as part of the NASA ATLAS-1 mission. We describe the in-flight instrument performance and provide a preliminary view of some of the results. Twenty-two wide-field far-ultraviolet images were obtained. At this stage of our analysis, we have far-ultraviolet photometry for more than 4800 sources; the overwhelming majority of these are below the TD-1 satellite far-ultraviolet detection limit. In these images, we detect sources to a flux limit of 1 × 10-14 ergs s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1, which is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than the TD-1 satellite, and we have virtually complete source detections to a level of 6 × 10-14 ergs s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1. Among the sources detected, we have identified a subset which show substantial far-ultraviolet excess.},

	Abstract = {The Kepler mission was designed to determine the frequency of Earth-sized planets in and near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The habitable zone is the region where planetary temperatures are suitable for water to exist on a planet's surface. During the first 6 weeks of observations, Kepler monitored 156,000 stars, and five new exoplanets with sizes between 0.37 and 1.6 Jupiter radii and orbital periods from 3.2 to 4.9 days were discovered. The density of the Neptune-sized Kepler-4b is similar to that of Neptune and GJ 436b, even though the irradiation level is 800,000 times higher. Kepler-7b is one of the lowest-density planets (~0.17 gram per cubic centimeter) yet detected. Kepler-5b, -6b, and -8b confirm the existence of planets with densities lower than those predicted for gas giant planets.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the development and progression of the VISTA telescope, from conception to the point where it is now being operated by the scientific community (end user). It analyses and evaluates the value of effective project management and systems engineering practices with practical examples. The practical application of systems engineering is addressed throughout the requirement capture and management, design, manufacture, assembly, and installation, integration, verification and acceptance phases, highlighting the value gained by appropriate application of step-by-step procedures and tools. The special emphasis given to the importance of effective systems engineering during on-site installation, verification and validation will be illustrated. Project management aspects are covered from tendering and procurement through contractor management processes to final integration and commissioning, with great emphasis placed on the importance of a "win-win" approach and the benefits of effective, constructive customer/contractor liaison. Consideration is given to the details and practicalities of day-to-day site management, safety, housekeeping, and the management and support of site personnel and services. Recommendations are made to improve the effectiveness of UK ATC system engineering and project management so that future projects can benefit from the lessons learned on VISTA.},

	Abstract = {Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0<z<1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections.},

	Abstract = {VENGA is a large-scale extragalactic IFU survey, which maps the bulges, bars and large parts of the outer disks of 32 nearby normal spiral galaxies. The targets are chosen to span a wide range in Hubble types, star formation activities, morphologies, and inclinations, at the same time of having vast available multi-wavelength coverage from the far-UV to the mid-IR, and available CO and 21cm mapping. The VENGA dataset will provide 2D maps of the SFR, stellar and gas kinematics, chemical abundances, ISM density and ionization states, dust extinction and stellar populations for these 32 galaxies. The uniqueness of the VIRUS-P large field of view permits these large-scale mappings to be performed. VENGA will allow us to correlate all these important quantities throughout the different environments present in galactic disks, allowing the conduction of a large number of studies in star formation, structure assembly, galactic feedback and ISM in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We apply the stellar population synthesis code by Cid Fernandes et al. to model the stellar contribution for a sample of 209 type II active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 0.3 < z < 0.83 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The reliable stellar velocity dispersions (sigma*) are obtained for 33 type II AGNs with significant stellar absorption features. According to the L[OIII] criterion of 3 × 108Lsolar, 20 of which can be classified as type II quasars. We use the formula of Greene and Ho to obtain the corrected stellar velocity dispersions (sigmac*). We also calculate the supermassive black hole masses from sigmac* in these high-redshift type II AGNs. The [OIII] luminosity is correlated with the black hole mass (although no correlation between the extinction-corrected [OIII] luminosity and the black hole mass), and no correlation is found between the Eddington ratio and the [OIII] luminosity or the corrected [OIII] luminosity. Three sets of two-component profiles are used to fit multiple emission transitions ([OIII]lambdalambda4959, 5007 and [OII]lambdalambda3727, 3729) in these 33 stellar-light-subtracted spectra. We also measure the gas velocity dispersion (sigmag) from these multiple transitions, and find that the relation between sigmag and sigmac* becomes much weaker at higher redshifts than in smaller redshifts. The distribution of <sigmag/sigmac*> is 1.24 +/- 0.76 for the core [OIII] line and 1.20 +/- 0.96 for the [OII] line, which suggests that sigmag of the core [OIII] and [OII] lines can trace sigmac* within about 0.1 dex in the logarithm of sigmac*. For the secondary driver, we find that the deviation of sigmag from sigmac* is correlated with the Eddington ratio.},

@article{Benitez.etal.2009a,
	Abstract = {Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) provide a "standard ruler" of known physical length, making it one of the most promising probes of the nature of dark energy (DE). The detection of BAOs as an excess of power in the galaxy distribution at a certain scale requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. "Transversal" (or "angular") BAOs measure the angular size of this scale projected in the sky and provide information about the angular distance. "Line-of-sight" (or "radial") BAOs require very precise redshifts, but provide a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, a more sensitive probe of DE. The main goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to obtain photometric redshifts with enough precision (sigma z ) to measure BAOs along the line of sight. There is a fundamental limitation as to how much one can improve the BAO measurement by reducing sigma z . We show that sigma z  ~ 0.003(1 + z) is sufficient: a much better precision will produce an oversampling of the BAO peak without a significant improvement on its detection, while a much worse precision will result in the effective loss of the radial information. This precision in redshift can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, featuring a prominent 4000 {\AA} break, by using a filter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width close to 100 {\AA}, covering the wavelength range from ~4000 to ~8000 {\AA}, supplemented by two broad-band filters similar to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey u and z bands. We describe the practical implementation of this idea, a new galaxy survey project, PAU16Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU): http://www.ice.cat/pau., to be carried out with a telescope/camera combination with an etendue about 20 m2 deg2, equivalent to a 2 m telescope equipped with a 6 deg2 field of view camera, and covering 8000 deg2 in the sky in four years. We expect to measure positions and redshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with L > L sstarf and iAB lsim 22.5 in the redshift interval 0.1 < z < 0.9, with a precision sigma z  < 0.003(1 + z). This population has a number density n gsim 10-3 Mpc-3 h 3 galaxies within the 9 Gpc3 h -3 volume to be sampled by our survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the BAO scale is not limited by shot noise. By itself, such a survey will deliver precisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, if assumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined with future cosmic microwave background measurements. In addition, PAU will yield high-quality redshift and low-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies, including a very significant high-redshift population. The data set produced by this survey will have a unique legacy value, allowing a wide range of astrophysical studies.},

	Abstract = {We measure spectral indexes for 1823 galaxies in the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology 1 (CNOC1) sample of 15 X-ray luminous clusters at 0.18<z<0.55 to investigate the mechanisms responsible for differential evolution between galaxy cluster and field environments. The radial trends of D4000, W0(Hdelta), and W0(O II) are all consistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center. Throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older stellar populations than field galaxies; they have weaker W0(O II) and W0(Hdelta) lines and stronger D4000 indexes. From our primary sample of 1413 galaxies, statistically corrected for incompleteness and selection effects, we identify a sample of K+A galaxies, which have strong Hdelta absorption lines [W0(Hdelta)>5 {\AA}] but no [O II] emission [W0(O II)<5 {\AA}], perhaps indicative of recently terminated star formation. The observed fraction of 4.4%+/-0.7% in the cluster sample is an overestimate due to a systematic effect that results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral index measurements. Corrected for this bias, we estimate that K+A galaxies make up only 2.1%+/-0.7% of the cluster sample and 0.1%+/-0.7% of the field. From the subsample of galaxies more luminous than Mr=-18.8+5logh, which is statistically representative of a complete sample to this limit, the corrected fraction of K+A galaxies is 1.5%+/-0.8% in the cluster and 1.2%+/-0.8% in the field. Compared with the z~0.1 fraction of 0.30%, the fraction of K+A galaxies in the CNOC1 field sample is greater by perhaps a factor of 4, but with only 1 sigma significance; no further evolution of this fraction is detectable over our redshift range. We compare our data with the results of PEGASE and GISSEL96 spectrophotometric models and conclude, from the relative fractions of red and blue galaxies with no [O II] lambda3727 emission and strong Hdelta absorption, that up to 1.9%+/-0.8% of the cluster population may have had its star formation recently truncated without a starburst. However, this is still not significantly greater than the fraction of such galaxies in the field, 3.1%+/-1.0%. Furthermore, we do not detect an excess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone starbursts within the last 1 Gyr. In fact, at 6.3%+/-2.1%, the A+em galaxies that Poggianti et al. have recently suggested are dusty starbursts are twice as common in the field as in the cluster environment. Our results imply that these cluster environments are not responsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxy fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster-specific phenomenon. We suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a gradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disks over fairly long timescales; in this case differential evolution may result because field galaxies can refuel their disks with gas from extended halos, thus regenerating star formation, while cluster galaxies may not have such halos and so continue to evolve passively.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the bivariate distribution, in color versus absolute magnitude (u-r vs. Mr), of a low-redshift sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (2400 deg2, 0.004<z<0.08, -23.5<Mr<-15.5). We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions (Mr=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2×1010 Msolar after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M*=-21.5, alpha=-0.8) compared to the blue distribution (alpha~-1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3×1010 Msolar. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained the mass-metallicity (M-Z) relation at different lookback times for the same set of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, using the stellar metallicities estimated with our spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT. We have found that this relation steepens and spans a wider range in both mass and metallicity at higher redshifts. We have modelled the time evolution of stellar metallicity with a closed-box chemical evolution model, for galaxies of different types and masses. Our results suggest that the M-Z relation for galaxies with present-day stellar masses down to 1010Msolar is mainly driven by the history of star formation and not by inflows or outflows.},

@article{Asari.etal.2007a,
	Abstract = {This paper, the sixth in the Semi-Empirical Analysis of Galaxies series, studies the evolution of 82302 star-forming (SF) galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Star formation histories (SFHs) are derived from detailed spectral fits obtained with our publicly available spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT. Our main goals are to explore new ways to derive SFHs from the synthesis results and apply them to investigate how SFHs vary as a function of nebular metallicity (Zneb). A number of refinements over our previous work are introduced, including (1) an improved selection criterion; (2) a careful examination of systematic residuals around Hbeta (3) self-consistent determination of nebular extinctions and metallicities; (4) tests with several Zneb estimators; (5) a study of the effects of the reddening law adopted and of the relation between nebular and stellar extinctions and the interstellar component of the NaI D doublet.  Our main achievements may be summarized as follows. (1) A conventional correlation analysis is performed to study how global properties relate to Zneb, leading to the confirmation of previously known relations, such as those between Zneb and galaxy luminosity, mass, dust content, mean stellar metallicity and mean stellar age. (2) A simple formalism which compresses the results of the synthesis while at the same time yielding time-dependent star formation rates (SFR) and mass assembly histories is presented. (3) A comparison of the current SFR derived from the population synthesis with that obtained from Halpha shows that these independent estimators agree very well, with a scatter of a factor of 2. An important corollary of this finding is that we now have a way to estimate SFR in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei, where the Halpha method cannot be applied. (4) Fully time-dependent SFHs were derived for all galaxies, and then averaged over six Zneb bins spanning the entire SF wing in the diagram. (5) We find that SFHs vary systematically along the SF sequence. Though all SF galaxies formed the bulk of their stellar mass over 1 Gyr ago, low-Zneb systems evolve at a slower pace and are currently forming stars at a much higher relative rate. Galaxies at the tip of the SF wing have current specific SFRs about two orders of magnitude larger than the metal-rich galaxies at its bottom. (6) At any given time, the distribution of specific SFRs for galaxies within a Zneb bin is broad and approximately lognormal. (7) The whole study was repeated grouping galaxies within bins of stellar mass and surface mass density, both of which are more fundamental drivers of SFH. Given the existence of strong Zneb - M* - Sigma* relations, the overall picture described above remains valid. Thus, low-M* (low-Sigma*) systems are the ones which evolve slower, with current specific SFRs much larger than more massive (dense) galaxies. (8) This overall pattern of SFHs as a function of Zneb,M* or Sigma* is robust against changes in selection criteria, choice of evolutionary synthesis models for the spectral fits, and differential extinction effects.},

@article{SanchezAlmeida.etal.2010a,
	Abstract = {Using the k-means cluster analysis algorithm, we carry out an unsupervised classification of all galaxy spectra in the seventh and final Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release (SDSS/DR7). Except for the shift to rest-frame wavelengths and the normalization to the g-band flux, no manipulation is applied to the original spectra. The algorithm guarantees that galaxies with similar spectra belong to the same class. We find that 99% of the galaxies can be assigned to only 17 major classes, with 11 additional minor classes including the remaining 1%. The classification is not unique since many galaxies appear in between classes; however, our rendering of the algorithm overcomes this weakness with a tool to identify borderline galaxies. Each class is characterized by a template spectrum, which is the average of all the spectra of the galaxies in the class. These low-noise template spectra vary smoothly and continuously along a sequence labeled from 0 to 27, from the reddest class to the bluest class. Our Automatic Spectroscopic K-means-based (ASK) classification separates galaxies in colors, with classes characteristic of the red sequence, the blue cloud, as well as the green valley. When red sequence galaxies and green valley galaxies present emission lines, they are characteristic of active galactic nucleus activity. Blue galaxy classes have emission lines corresponding to star formation regions. We find the expected correlation between spectroscopic class and Hubble type, but this relationship exhibits a high intrinsic scatter. Several potential uses of the ASK classification are identified and sketched, including fast determination of physical properties by interpolation, classes as templates in redshift determinations, and target selection in follow-up works (we find classes of Seyfert galaxies, green valley galaxies, as well as a significant number of outliers). The ASK classification is publicly accessible through various Web sites.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) presents the first spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This ninth data release (DR9) of the SDSS project includes 535,995 new galaxy spectra (median z ~ 0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra (median z ~ 2.32), and 90,897 new stellar spectra, along with the data presented in previous data releases. These spectra were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009 December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in temperature estimates for stars with T eff < 5000 K and in metallicity estimates for stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5. DR9 includes new stellar parameters for all stars presented in DR8, including stars from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed as part of the SEGUE-2. The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III will be in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the APOGEE along with another year of data from BOSS, followed by the final SDSS-III data release in 2014 December.},

	Abstract = {The classification of QSO rest-frame optical and UV spectra is undertaken by means of a statistical principal component analysis (PCA) emphasizing the relation between QSO properties. The PCA is applied directly to a sample of QSO UV spectra from the Large Bright QSO Survey, and relations are studied between continuum, emission-line, and broad-absorption-line properties. Quantitative classifications are derived based on a limited number of principal components, and three components account for approximately 75 percent of the sample and describe: emission-line core strength, continuum slope, and broad absorption features. Broad-absorption-line QSOs appear as a natural subclass of the population with characteristic excess emissions, and continuum hardness correlates with the equivalent widths of C IV and Lyman-alpha emission lines. Quantitative properties are derived from the study that serve to classify QSO emissions ranging from broad low-equivalent-width lines to narrow high-equivalent-width lines.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated some statistical properties of integrated spectra of galaxies from the Kennicutt spectrophotometric atlas. The input data for the analysis are galaxy spectra sampled in 1300 bins between 3750 and 6500Angstroms. We make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyse the 1300-dimensional space spanned by the spectra. Their projection on to the plane defined by the first two principal components, the principal plane, shows that normal galaxies are in a quasi-linear sequence that we call the spectral sequence. We show that the spectral sequence is closely related to the Hubble morphological sequence. These results are robust in the sense that the reality of the spectral sequence does not depend on data normalization. The existence of this sequence suggests that a single parameter may describe the spectrum of normal galaxies. We have investigated this hypothesis with the Bruzual & Charlot models of spectral evolution. We show that, for single-age models (15 Gyr), the spectral sequence can be parametrized by the characteristic star formation time-scales of the different morphological types. By examining the projection of evolutionary tracks of normal galaxies on to the principal plane, we verify that the spectral sequence is also an evolutionary sequence, with galaxy spectra evolving from later to earlier spectral types. Considering the close correspondence between the spectral and morphological sequences, this leads us to speculate that galaxies may evolve morphologically along the Hubble sequence, from Sm/Im to E.},

@article{Ferreras.etal.2006a,
	Abstract = {Environmental differences in the stellar populations of early-type galaxies are explored using principal component analysis (PCA), focusing on differences between elliptical galaxies in Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) and in the field. The method is model-independent and purely relies on variations between the observed spectra. The projections (PC1, PC2) of the observed spectra on the first and second principal components reveal a difference with respect to environment, with a wider range in PC1 and PC2 in the group sample. We define a spectral parameter (zeta ≡ 0.36PC1-PC2) which simplifies this result to a single number: field galaxies have a very similar value of zeta, whereas HCG galaxies span a wide range in this parameter. The segregation is found regardless of the way the input spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are presented to PCA (i.e. changing the spectral range; using uncalibrated data; subtracting the continuum or masking the SED to include only the Lick spectral regions). Simple models are applied to give physical meaning to the PCs. We obtain a strong correlation between the values of zeta and the mass fraction in younger stars, so that some group galaxies present a higher fraction of them, implying a more complex star formation history in groups. Regarding `dynamically related' observables such as a4 or velocity dispersion, we find a correlation with PC3, but not with either PC1 or PC2. PCA is more sensitive than other methods based on a direct analysis of observables such as the structure of the surface brightness profile or the equivalent width of absorption lines. The latter do not reveal any significant variation between field and compact group galaxies. Our results imply that the presence of young stars only amounts to a fraction of a per cent in its contribution to the total variance, reflecting the power of PCA as a tool to extract small variations in the spectra from unresolved stellar populations.},

@article{Rogers.etal.2007a,
	Abstract = {We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to a sample of early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in order to infer differences in their star formation histories from their unresolved stellar populations. We select a z < 0.1 volume-limited sample comprising ~7000 early-type galaxies from SDSS/Data Release 4. Out of the first few principal components (PC), we study four which give information about stellar populations and velocity dispersion. We construct two parameters (eta and zeta) as linear combinations of PC1 and PC2. The four components can be presented as `optimal filters' to explore in detail the properties of the underlying stellar populations. By comparing various photospectroscopic observables - including near-ultraviolet (NUV) photometry from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) - we find zeta to be most sensitive to recent episodes of star formation, and eta to be strongly dependent on the average age of the stellar populations. Both eta and zeta also depend on metallicity. We apply these optimal filters to composite spectra assembled by Bernardi et al. The distribution of the eta component of the composites appear to be indistinguishable between high- and low-density regions, whereas the distribution of zeta parameters have a significant skew towards lower values for galaxies in low-density regions. This result suggests that galaxies in lower density environments are less likely to present weak episodes of recent star formation. In contrast, a significant number of galaxies from our high-density subsample - which includes clusters (both outer regions and centres) and groups - underwent small but detectable recent star formation at high metallicity, in agreement with recent estimates targeting elliptical galaxies in Hickson Compact Groups and in the field.},

	Abstract = {We use the average E(B-V) and ZnII column densities of a sample of z~ 1 CaIIlambdalambda 3935, 3970 absorption-line systems selected from the fourth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to show that on average, with conservative assumptions regarding metallicities and dust-to-gas ratios, they contain column densities of neutral hydrogen greater than the damped Lyman alpha (DLA) limit. We propose that selection by CaII absorption is an effective way of identifying high column densities of neutral hydrogen, and thus large samples of DLAs at zabs<~ 1.3 from the SDSS. The number density of strong CaII absorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width Wlambda3935>= 0.5{\AA}), is ~20-30 per cent that of DLAs, after correcting for the significant bias against their detection due to obscuration of the background quasars by dust. On average these absorbers have E(B-V) >~ 0.1mag the dustiest absorbers show depletions of refractory elements at a level of the largest depletions seen in DLAs. For the first time we can measure the dust-to-metals ratio in a sample of absorption-selected galaxies, and find values close to, or even larger than, those observed locally. All of these properties suggest that a substantial fraction of the CaII absorbers are more chemically evolved than typical DLAs. There is a trend of increasing dust content with Wlambda3935 this trend with strong-line equivalent width is also observed in an equivalent, but much larger, sample of MgII absorbers. Such a trend would result if the dustier systems are hosted by more massive, or disturbed, galaxies. Follow-up imaging is required to provide conclusive evidence for or against these scenarios. From consideration of the E(B-V) distribution in our sample, and assuming CaII absorbers represent a subset of DLAs, we calculate that dust obscuration causes an underestimation in the number density of DLAs by at least 8-12 per cent at these redshifts. Finally, the removal of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the SDSS quasar sample increases the sensitivity of the detection of reddening by intervening absorbers. To this end, we describe a new, automated, principal component analysis (PCA) method for identifying BAL quasars.},

The observations span from the radio to the millimetre and optical, and provide multicolour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of the atomic (H I), molecular (CO) and ionized gas (Hbeta, [O III] and [N I]), together with the kinematics and population of the stars (Hbeta, Fe5015 and Mg b), for a carefully selected, volume-limited (1.16 × 105 Mpc3) sample of 260 early-type (elliptical E and lenticular S0) galaxies (ETGs). The models include semi-analytic, N-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the science goals for the project and introduce the galaxy sample and the selection criteria. The sample consists of nearby (D < 42 Mpc, |delta- 29$\,^{\circ}$| < 35$\,^{\circ}$, |b| > 15$\,^{\circ}$) morphologically selected ETGs extracted from a parent sample of 871 galaxies (8 per cent E, 22 per cent S0 and 70 per cent spirals) brighter than MK < -21.5 mag (stellar mass M*≳ 6 ×109 M&sun;). We analyse possible selection biases and we conclude that the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representative of the nearby galaxy population. We present the size-luminosity relation for the spirals and ETGs and show that the ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample define a tight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in the transition from the blue cloud. We describe the strategy of the SAURON integral field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics with the pPXF method. We find typical 1sigma errors of DeltaV≈ 6 km s-1, Deltasigma≈ 7 km s-1, Deltah3≈Deltah4≈ 0.03 in the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite (GH) moments for galaxies with effective dispersion sigmae≳ 120 km s-1. For galaxies with lower sigmae (≈40 per cent of the sample) the GH moments are gradually penalized by pPXF towards zero to suppress the noise produced by the spectral undersampling and only V and sigma can be measured. We give an overview of the characteristics of the other main data sets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modelling projects.},

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field.},

	Abstract = {We have combined H-alpha and UBV measurements of 210 nearby Sa-Irr galaxies with new photometric synthesis models to reanalyze the past and future star formation timescales in disks. The integrated photoionization rates and colors of disks are best fitted by a stellar initial mass function (IMF) which is enriched in massive stars by a factor of 2-3 relative to the Scalo solar neighborhood IMF. We have used published surface photometry of spiral galaxies to analyze the star formation histories of disks independent of their bulge properties. The ratio of the current star formation rate (SFR) to the average past rate increases from of order 0.01 in Sa galaxies to 1 in Sc-Irr disks. This confirms that the pronounced change in the photometric properties of spiral galaxies along the Hubble sequence is predominantly due to changes in the star formation histories of disks, and only secondarily to changes in the bulge/disk ratio. A comparison of current SFRs and gas masses of the sample yields median timescales for gas consumption of approximately 3 Gyr, in the absence of stellar recycling. However, a proper time-dependent treatment of the gas return from stars shows that recycling extends the gas lifetimes of disks by factors of 1.5-4 for typical disk parameters. Consequently the current SFRs in many (but not all) disks can be sustained for periods comparable to the Hubble time.},

@article{CidFernandes.etal.2010a,
	Abstract = {A numerous population of weak line galaxies (WLGs) is often left out of statistical studies on emission-line galaxies (ELGs) due to the absence of an adequate classification scheme, since classical diagnostic diagrams, such as [OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha (the BPT diagram), require the measurement of at least four emission lines. This paper aims to remedy this situation by transposing the usual divisory lines between star-forming (SF) galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts and between Seyferts and LINERs to diagrams that are more economical in terms of line quality requirements. By doing this, we rescue from the classification limbo a substantial number of sources and modify the global census of ELGs. More specifically, (1) we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to constitute a suitable sample of 280000 ELGs, one-third of which are WLGs. (2) Galaxies with strong emission lines are classified using the widely applied criteria of Kewley et al., Kauffmann et al. and Stasinska et al. to distinguish SF galaxies and AGN hosts and Kewley et al. to distinguish Seyferts from LINERs. (3) We transpose these classification schemes to alternative diagrams keeping [NII]/Halpha as a horizontal axis, but replacing Hbeta by a stronger line (Halpha or [OII]), or substituting the ionization-level sensitive [OIII]/Hbeta ratio with the equivalent width of Halpha (WHalpha). Optimized equations for the transposed divisory lines are provided. (4) We show that nothing significant is lost in the translation, but that the new diagrams allow one to classify up to 50 per cent more ELGs. (5) Introducing WLGs in the census of galaxies in the local Universe increases the proportion of metal-rich SF galaxies and especially LINERs.  In the course of this analysis, we were led to make the following points. (i) The Kewley et al. BPT line for galaxy classification is generally ill-used. (ii) Replacing [OIII]/Hbeta by WHalpha in the classification introduces a change in the philosophy of the distinction between LINERs and Seyferts, but not in its results. Because the WHalpha versus [NII]/Halpha diagram can be applied to the largest sample of ELGs without loss of discriminating power between Seyferts and LINERs, we recommend its use in further studies. (iii) The dichotomy between Seyferts and LINERs is washed out by WLGs in the BPT plane, but it subsists in other diagnostic diagrams. This suggests that the right wing in the BPT diagram is indeed populated by at least two classes, tentatively identified with bona fide AGN and `retired' galaxies that have stopped forming stars and are ionized by their old stellar populations.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the Halpha and infrared star formation rate (SFR) diagnostics for galaxies in the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS). For the 81 galaxies in our sample, we derive Halpha fluxes (included here) from integrated spectra. There is a strong correlation between the ratio of far-infrared to optical luminosities L(FIR)/L(Halpha) and the extinction E(B-V) measured with the Balmer decrement. Before reddening correction, the SFR(IR) and SFR(Halpha) are related to each other by a power law: SFR(IR)=(2.7+/-0.3)SFR(Halpha)1.30+/-0.06. Correction of the SFR(Halpha) for extinction using the Balmer decrement and a classical reddening curve both reduces the scatter in the SFR(IR)-SFR(Halpha) correlation and results in a much closer agreement between the two SFR indicators; SFR(IR)=(0.91+/-0.04)SFR(Halphacorr)1.07+/-0.03. SFR(IR) and SFR(Halpha) agree to ~10%. This SFR relationship spans 4 orders of magnitude and holds for all Hubble types with IRAS detections in the NFGS. A constant ratio between the SFR(IR) and SFR(Halpha) for all Hubble types, including early types (S0-Sab), suggests that the IR emission in all these objects results from a young stellar population.},
